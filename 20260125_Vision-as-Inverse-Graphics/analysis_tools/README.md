VLM query scripts for analyzing target layouts and understanding iteration results.

## chip2_vlm_queries/

Systematic VLM analysis tools developed during chip2.png iteration study (iterations 1-19).

These scripts demonstrate effective VLM querying patterns:
- Multi-query analysis with focused questions
- Regional cropping and detailed examination
- Component inventory and counting
- Comparative analysis (what worked vs what didn't)

See DevLog-001 Section 13 for methodology and lessons learned.
