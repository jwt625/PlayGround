# Procedural Generation Pipeline (Stage-by-Stage)

## Stage A: Structural Initialization

1. **Establish coordinate origin and layout center**  
   The coordinate origin is now placed at the geometric center of the room’s floor, corresponding to **(1.5, 1.5, 0)** in the old coordinate system.  
   - **+X axis** → toward the lounge, clock, and small tree decorations  
   - **+Y axis** → toward the viewer / sofa area  
   - **+Z axis** → upward  
   This ensures consistent right-handed alignment and intuitive spatial orientation.

2. **Build the basic room frame**  
   Create four walls, a floor, and a ceiling.  
   Add a ceiling lamp at the geometric center as the main light source.  
   Keep the overall room scale within roughly **3 units** across each dimension.

3. **Set up the camera**  
   Position the camera to face the new coordinate origin, capturing the floor and two adjacent walls.

## Stage B: Core Furniture Construction

Sequentially generate (use 'get_better_object' tool) and place the following objects:

---

### 1. **Lounge Set**  
Includes the sofa, floor lamp, coffee table, round rug, and snowman.

- **Coordinates:** **(x ≈ 0.0, y ≈ 0.5, z ≈ 0.5)**  
  *Position: centered horizontally, slightly toward the viewer, with its center slightly above the ground.*

---

### 2. **Main Christmas Tree**

- **Coordinates:** **(x ≈ −1.0, y ≈ −1.0, z ≈ 1.0)**  
  *Position: located in the left–rear corner area, close to the back wall.*

---

### 3. **Gift Boxes**

Place multiple gift boxes beneath and around the main tree.

- **Coordinates:** near **(x ≈ −1.0, y ≈ −1.0, z slightly < 1.0)**  
  *Position: clustered at the left–rear corner under the tree.*

---

### 4. **Fireplace**

- **Coordinates:** **(x ≈ −1.3, y ≈ 0.0, z ≈ 1.0)**  
  *Position: centered along the left wall, mid-depth of the room.*

---

### 5. **Golden Bells (above fireplace)**

- **Coordinates:** **(x ≈ −1.3, y ≈ 0.0, z ≈ 2.5)**  
  *Position: mounted high on the left wall directly above the fireplace.*

---

### 6. **Clock Above Lounge**

- **Coordinates:** **(x ≈ −0.5, y ≈ 1.3, z ≈ 2.5)**  
  *Position: on the front wall, upper-left region relative to the lounge.*

---

### 7. **Small Tree Decorations Near the Clock**

- **Small Tree 1**  
  **Coordinates:** **(x ≈ 0.25, y ≈ 1.3, z ≈ 2.5)**  
  *Position: front wall, upper-right of the clock.*

- **Small Tree 2**  
  **Coordinates:** **(x ≈ 1.0, y ≈ 1.3, z ≈ 2.5)**  
  *Position: front wall, near the far-right upper corner.*

---

### 8. **(Optional) Auxiliary Decorations**

Add string lights along the tops of the walls and ceiling edges.  
Add picture frames or other small ornaments to enhance realism.

---

## Stage C: Lighting and Rendering

1. **Add main light sources**  
   Use the ceiling lamp for overall diffusion; complement it with warm lighting from the fireplace and string lights.

2. **Adjust ambient lighting**  
   Apply a warm, cozy color tone with soft shadows and subtle ambient occlusion.

3. **Render and tone adjustments**  
   Use warm white balance, slightly increase saturation,  
   and enable soft diffusion for a festive atmosphere.

## ✔ Notes for the model
- Ensure all objects rest properly on their surfaces.  
- Maintain consistent scale and avoid interpenetration.  
- Keep coordinates within a reasonable centered range.  
- Optimize for visual balance and spatial clarity.
- If you can see the initial scene, it means there's a camera in the scene; do not modify the camera. If you cannot see the initial scene, it means there's no camera in the scene; you need to add one yourself to observe the scene.
