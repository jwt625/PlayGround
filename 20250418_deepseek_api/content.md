1. A grain of rice size pacemaker that is fully bioresorbable... (mostly made with Mg, Mo, and Si)
It even got a phototransistor for wireless optoelectronic control.

   - there is a video, looks pretty sick: [Digital Mechanical Metamaterials](https://youtube.com/watch?v=A0lJUzcKDsY…)
   - probably printed the channel too tight, takes quite some force & can't really cascade because of the force would accumulate too fast & would not continue triggering without me pushing on the whole chain

   - this and the digital mechanical door lock earlier today were found in this review, it is open access and has a lot of fancy mech stuff inside.
Feels like this kind of mech computing is really for weird applications in weird environments

7. I don't like "twistronics" but this twisted photonic crystal is pretty crazy
imagine bonding two chips with a sub um gap around the ~ 1 mm central area, and rotate one of them against the other one

9. in some fields people would rather share code with a screenshot in a paper instead of a github repo, and they are proud of it
(and they should, most people don't even talk about the code behind the work)

10. if you don't want droplets to splash when hitting a surface, charge them up
   - video from: [Charged Droplets Can Hit a Surface Without Splashing](https://physics.aps.org/articles/v18/74)
Seems like it's because the lamella gets attracted to the surface from electrostatic force.

11. powering LEDs with water droplets, not from the kinetic energy but from charge transfer 

(they are using 400 LEDs because the optimal load resistance is ~ 1 MΩ, and peak power density is actually as high as 50 W/m^2, and efficiency of 2.2%, kind of crazy)

   - papers cite papers

do the charges help with the "hunted down" part or for spreading out the droplets better (or both)

still very useful tho, this one is a real-time 3D drift correction for super-resolution microscopy.

   - [Roadmap for Photonics with 2D Materials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04558)
   - nice
@photonsnpixels
 this is your expertise iirc

22. I had this random thought: why can't I curl or wget some material properties.

Turns out you almost can. This one is quite nice, and got built-in API. If you are confused about Brillouin Zone etc, it even got interactive plots to help you get even more confused.

it's just not as comprehensive or fit your need as much, but you could contribute to the properties.

24. Trying out OmniParser on comsol gui and it froze my poor M4 mini.. so here is part of the gui

   - that'd actually be a good criteria lol, comsol's gui is already one of the better ones imo..
   - it's unlikely aware of the structure of the components. It returns a list of components and their properties, including text from OCR, and icons from YOLO, and tries to guess what the icons mean
