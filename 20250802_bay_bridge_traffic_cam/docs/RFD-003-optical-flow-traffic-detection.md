**Authors:** Wentao Jiang, Augment Agent
**Date:** 2025-01-03
**Status:** Implemented
**Supersedes:** None (Alternative to RFD-001 background subtraction approach)

## Summary

This RFD documents the development and implementation of a dense optical flow-based traffic detection system specifically engineered for the Bay Bridge side-view monitoring scenario where approximately 80% of vehicles are occluded by bridge infrastructure. The system replaces traditional background subtraction with Farneback optical flow to detect motion patterns from partially visible vehicle components, achieving superior performance in heavily occluded environments.

## Background and Problem Statement

### Limitations of Background Subtraction for Heavy Occlusion

The motion-based detection system (RFD-001) using background subtraction encounters fundamental limitations in the Bay Bridge scenario:

1. **Shape Dependency**: Background subtraction requires visible object boundaries and contours
2. **Occlusion Sensitivity**: Fails when 80% of vehicles are hidden behind bridge structure
3. **Fragmentation Issues**: Partially visible vehicles create disconnected motion regions
4. **Noise Amplification**: Bridge shadows, lighting changes, and structural elements generate false positives
5. **Minimum Size Requirements**: Small visible vehicle parts fall below detection thresholds

### Bridge-Specific Challenges

**Structural Occlusion:**
- Bridge deck blocks lower vehicle portions (wheels, undercarriage)
- Side railings obscure vehicle profiles
- Support structures create intermittent occlusion patterns
- Only roof lines, upper windows, and antenna portions remain visible

**Perspective Issues:**
- Side-view angle reduces vehicle width to thin vertical slices
- Distance variation: near vehicles (100+ pixels) vs far vehicles (15-25 pixels)
- Depth perception challenges for overlapping vehicles

**Environmental Factors:**
- Camera vibration from bridge traffic and wind
- Dynamic lighting conditions throughout the day
- Weather effects (rain, fog) reducing visibility
- Shadow movement from bridge structural elements

### Optical Flow Advantages for Occluded Scenarios

Motion-based detection using optical flow is optimal because:
- **Pixel-level motion detection**: Works on individual moving pixels, not object shapes
- **Occlusion tolerance**: Detects motion from any visible vehicle component
- **Scale independence**: Effective on tiny moving regions (5-10 pixels)
- **Immediate operation**: No background model training required
- **Coherent motion analysis**: Groups pixels with consistent movement patterns

## Implementation Details

### Performance Optimizations

#### Frame Capture Strategy - Enhanced for 30+ FPS
```python
# AGGRESSIVE OPTIMIZATION: High-performance capture (25-30+ FPS)
def get_frame(self):
    if not self.cap_initialized:
        self.cap = cv2.VideoCapture(self.webcam_url)
        # PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION: Aggressive capture settings for 30+ FPS
        self.cap.set(cv2.CAP_PROP_BUFFERSIZE, 1)     # Minimal buffer for latest frame
        self.cap.set(cv2.CAP_PROP_FPS, 60)           # Request maximum FPS
        self.cap.set(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_WIDTH, 1280) # Set resolution if needed
        self.cap.set(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_HEIGHT, 720)
        # Additional optimizations
        self.cap.set(cv2.CAP_PROP_FOURCC, cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc('M','J','P','G'))
        self.cap_initialized = True

    ret, frame = self.cap.read()  # Reuse connection
    return frame if ret else None
```

#### Optical Flow Configuration - Optimized for Speed
```python
# Farneback parameters - AGGRESSIVE SPEED OPTIMIZATION
self.flow_params = {
    'pyr_scale': 0.5,    # Image pyramid scaling factor
    'levels': 1,         # REDUCED to 1 for maximum speed (was 3)
    'winsize': 8,        # REDUCED to 8 for speed (was 15)
    'iterations': 1,     # REDUCED to 1 for speed (was 3)
    'poly_n': 3,         # REDUCED to 3 for speed (was 5)
    'poly_sigma': 1.0,   # REDUCED for speed (was 1.2)
    'flags': 0           # Algorithm flags
}
```

#### Frame Resolution Optimization
```python
# AGGRESSIVE frame scaling for maximum performance
self.max_processing_width = 640   # REDUCED to 640 for speed (was 1280)
self.force_downscale = True       # Force downscaling for better performance

# Always scale down for maximum performance
if self.force_downscale or roi_frame.shape[1] > self.max_processing_width:
    scale_factor = self.max_processing_width / roi_frame.shape[1]
    scale_factor = min(scale_factor, 0.5)  # Never use more than half resolution
    new_width = int(roi_frame.shape[1] * scale_factor)
    new_height = int(roi_frame.shape[0] * scale_factor)
    processing_frame = cv2.resize(roi_frame, (new_width, new_height), interpolation=cv2.INTER_LINEAR)
```

### Detection Pipeline

#### 1. Dense Optical Flow Calculation
```python
# Calculate flow between consecutive frames
flow = cv2.calcOpticalFlowFarneback(
    prev_gray, current_gray, None,
    pyr_scale=0.5, levels=3, winsize=15,
    iterations=3, poly_n=5, poly_sigma=1.2, flags=0
)

# Extract motion magnitude and direction
magnitude, angle = cv2.cartToPolar(flow[..., 0], flow[..., 1])
```

#### 2. Motion Region Detection - Performance Optimized
```python
# Create motion mask from flow magnitude
motion_mask = (magnitude > self.flow_threshold).astype(np.uint8) * 255

# PERFORMANCE: Simplified morphological operations
kernel = cv2.getStructuringElement(cv2.MORPH_ELLIPSE, (3, 3))  # Smaller kernel
motion_mask = cv2.morphologyEx(motion_mask, cv2.MORPH_OPEN, kernel, iterations=1)  # Single operation
```

#### 3. Simplified Motion Analysis - Major Performance Improvement
```python
# PERFORMANCE: Simplified contour filtering - MAJOR OPTIMIZATION
# Use bounding box for flow sampling instead of exact contour mask
x, y, w, h = cv2.boundingRect(contour)

# Sample flow in bounding box region (much faster than creating mask)
region_flow_x = flow[y:y+h, x:x+w, 0].flatten()
region_flow_y = flow[y:y+h, x:x+w, 1].flatten()

# Filter out zero flow areas
non_zero_mask = (region_flow_x != 0) | (region_flow_y != 0)
if np.sum(non_zero_mask) > 10:  # Need at least 10 flow vectors
    region_flow_x = region_flow_x[non_zero_mask]
    region_flow_y = region_flow_y[non_zero_mask]

    # SIMPLIFIED coherence calculation
    mean_flow_x = np.mean(region_flow_x)
    mean_flow_y = np.mean(region_flow_y)

    # Quick horizontal motion check
    horizontal_magnitude = abs(mean_flow_x)
    vertical_magnitude = abs(mean_flow_y)
    total_magnitude = np.sqrt(mean_flow_x**2 + mean_flow_y**2)
```

### Multi-Criteria Filtering with Horizontal Motion Enhancement

**Motion Magnitude Filtering:**
```python
flow_threshold = 5.0  # Minimum pixels/frame movement
```

**Size Filtering:**
```python
min_motion_area = 200   # Minimum pixels in motion region
max_motion_area = 3000  # Maximum pixels (filter large noise)
```

**Horizontal Motion Filtering (NEW):**
```python
horizontal_motion_only = True  # Filter out vertical movement
min_horizontal_ratio = 0.6     # Minimum ratio of horizontal to total motion
max_vertical_component = 3.0   # Maximum allowed vertical flow component

# Horizontal motion validation
if total_magnitude > self.flow_threshold:
    horizontal_ratio = horizontal_magnitude / total_magnitude
    horizontal_valid = (horizontal_ratio >= self.min_horizontal_ratio and
                       vertical_magnitude <= self.max_vertical_component)
```

**Performance Mode (NEW):**
```python
show_debug = False  # Disabled by default for 25-30+ FPS
force_downscale = True  # Always scale down for maximum performance
```

  - `Coh:X.XX` - Motion coherence value (0.0-1.0)
  - `Flow:(X.X,Y.Y)` - Average flow vector (dx, dy)
- **Flow arrows**: Red arrows from region center showing motion direction
- **Summary statistics**: Total regions, thresholds, and filter settings

### Interactive Debug Controls - Enhanced Performance Management

```

### Debug Information Display

Each debug window provides real-time information:
