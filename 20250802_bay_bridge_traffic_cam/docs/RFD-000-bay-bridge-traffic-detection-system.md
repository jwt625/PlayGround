**Authors:** Wentao Jiang, Augment Agent  
**Date:** 2025-08-02  
**Status:** Implemented  

## Summary

This RFD documents the development and implementation of a real-time traffic detection system that captures video frames from an iPhone webcam and uses YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection to identify cars and pedestrians. The system is designed for monitoring Bay Bridge traffic with configurable detection parameters and organized output management.

## Background

The goal was to create a minimal, effective system for traffic monitoring using readily available hardware (iPhone as webcam) and modern computer vision techniques. The system needed to:

1. Capture frames from iPhone webcam stream
2. Detect multiple object types (cars, pedestrians, motorcycles, buses, trucks)
3. Handle varying camera distances and object sizes
4. Provide organized output with timestamped results
5. Be easily configurable for different scenarios

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Webcam Interface** (`car_detector.py`)
   - OpenCV-based video capture with fallback to HTTP requests
   - Resolution optimization for highest quality capture
   - Support for multiple iPhone webcam apps (DroidCam, etc.)

2. **Object Detection Engine** (`car_detector.py`)
   - YOLOv8 nano model for real-time performance
   - Multi-class detection (person, car, motorcycle, bus, truck)
   - Configurable confidence thresholds per object type

3. **Configuration System** (`config.py`)
   - Centralized parameter management
   - Preset confidence levels (high_precision, balanced, high_recall)
   - Resolution and enhancement settings

4. **Output Management** (`car_detector.py`)
   - Timestamped directory structure
   - Original and annotated frame saving
   - Detailed detection logging

### Technology Stack

- **Python 3.11** with `uv` package management
- **OpenCV** for image processing and video capture
- **Ultralytics YOLOv8** for object detection
- **Requests** for HTTP-based video streaming
- **PIL/Pillow** for image format handling
- **NumPy** for array operations

## Implementation Details

### Video Capture Strategy

The system implements a dual-approach video capture:

1. **Primary Method**: OpenCV VideoCapture
   - Direct connection to video stream
   - Automatic resolution optimization
   - Hardware acceleration when available

2. **Fallback Method**: HTTP Requests
   - MJPEG stream parsing
   - Manual JPEG frame extraction
   - Robust error handling

### Detection Configuration

Three preset confidence levels optimized for different scenarios:

```python
CONFIDENCE_PRESETS = {
    "high_precision": {  # Fewer false positives
        "person": 0.6, "car": 0.7, "motorcycle": 0.6, 
        "bus": 0.7, "truck": 0.7
    },
    "balanced": {  # Standard detection
        "person": 0.4, "car": 0.5, "motorcycle": 0.4, 
        "bus": 0.5, "truck": 0.5
    },
    "high_recall": {  # Better for distant/small objects
        "person": 0.25, "car": 0.3, "motorcycle": 0.25, 
        "bus": 0.4, "truck": 0.4
    }
}
```

### Resolution Optimization

- **Automatic highest resolution**: Attempts 4K → 1440p → 1080p → 720p
- **Aspect ratio handling**: Converts portrait to landscape for traffic monitoring
- **Small object enhancement**: 1.2x upscaling for better distant object detection
- **Minimum resolution enforcement**: 640x480 baseline

## Testing Results

### Test Environment
- **iPhone Webcam**: DroidCam app at `http://192.168.12.6:4747/video`
- **Network**: Local WiFi (192.168.12.x subnet)
- **Capture Resolution**: 720x1280 (portrait) → processed to landscape
- **Camera Position**: Zoomed out view of Bay Bridge traffic

### Detection Performance

#### Test 1: Real Traffic Scene
- **Total Objects Detected**: 12 cars
- **Confidence Range**: 0.515 - 0.892
- **Frame Size**: 720x1280 pixels
- **Processing Time**: ~2-3 seconds per frame
- **False Positives**: None observed
- **False Negatives**: Minimal (small distant vehicles)

#### Test 2: Downloaded Traffic Image
- **Total Objects Detected**: 11 cars
- **Confidence Range**: 0.314 - 0.818
- **Image Source**: Unsplash traffic photo (800x600)
- **Detection Accuracy**: High precision, good recall

#### Test 3: Demo Mode
- **Synthetic Objects**: 3 drawn rectangles
- **Detection Result**: 0 cars (expected - synthetic shapes don't match YOLO training)
- **Purpose**: System validation without webcam dependency

### Configuration Validation

#### Webcam Connection Tests
- **Primary URL**: `http://192.168.12.6:4747/video` ✅ Working
- **Fallback Endpoints**: Tested 8 common endpoints, found working stream
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to demo mode when webcam unavailable
- **Timeout Handling**: 10-second timeout prevents hanging

#### Resolution Tests
- **Captured Resolution**: 720x1280 (iPhone portrait)
- **Enhancement**: 1.2x upscaling → 864x1536
- **Rotation**: Auto-convert to landscape when configured
- **Quality**: No significant degradation observed

## Configuration Management

### Centralized Config System

All parameters moved to `config.py` for easy adjustment:

```python
# Quick preset switching
CONFIDENCE_PRESET = "high_recall"  # For zoomed-out views

# Resolution optimization
USE_HIGHEST_RESOLUTION = True
ENHANCE_SMALL_OBJECTS = True
PREFERRED_ASPECT_RATIO = "landscape"

# Detection classes with individual thresholds
DETECTION_CLASSES = {
    0: {'name': 'person', 'min_confidence': 0.25, 'enabled': True},
    2: {'name': 'car', 'min_confidence': 0.3, 'enabled': True},
    # ... additional classes
}
```

### Output Organization

Timestamped directory structure:
```
outputs/
├── 20250802_143022/
│   ├── original_frame.jpg
│   └── detected_objects.jpg
└── 20250802_143156/
    ├── original_frame.jpg
    └── detected_objects.jpg
```

## Lessons Learned

### Technical Insights

1. **YOLO Model Selection**: YOLOv8n provides good balance of speed vs accuracy for real-time use
2. **Resolution Matters**: Higher resolution significantly improves small object detection
3. **Confidence Tuning**: Lower thresholds (0.25-0.3) necessary for distant objects
4. **Aspect Ratio**: Landscape orientation better for traffic monitoring than portrait

### Implementation Challenges

1. **iPhone Webcam Apps**: Different apps use different endpoints and protocols
2. **Network Reliability**: WiFi stability affects stream quality
3. **Resolution Negotiation**: Not all resolutions supported by all devices
4. **Processing Performance**: Balance between quality and speed

### Best Practices Established

1. **Configuration-Driven Design**: Centralized config enables quick adjustments
2. **Graceful Degradation**: Multiple fallback strategies prevent system failure
3. **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed output aids debugging and validation
4. **Modular Architecture**: Separate concerns for maintainability
