# First outpost — implementation journal

## 2026-09-11 — Starting implementation

Repository contains design documents, 11 transparent sprites, and a vector UI kit; no game runtime exists yet. Implementing milestones in 003 in dependency order. Preserve simulation/rendering separation and test energy/resource accounting independently of the UI.

Current work: foundation and scattering-network model.

## Outstanding risks

- Phase sensitivity must be understandable at tile scale; use a documented effective phase-per-tile model plus fine tuning.
- Sprite projection and anchors remain approximate; gameplay footprints and ports are defined in world coordinates.
- Small-map balancing needs human playtesting even if the loop passes automated tests.
