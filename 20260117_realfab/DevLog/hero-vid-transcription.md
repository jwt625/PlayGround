  America is facing a full-scale health emergency. More than 70% of adults are overweight or obese. More than half are diabetic or pre-diabetic.
  Chronic disease touches nearly every single American family.

  This did not happen by accident. It happened because real food was pushed aside. Replaced by highly processed products, junk food became the
  foundation of the modern American diet. And we're paying the price with our health.

  But that ends today. We are resetting what our nation eats. Real food is back at the center of the American diet. Real food that nourishes the
  body. That restores health. That brings back energy. And that builds strength.

  This is what it takes to make America healthy again. Under the leadership of President Trump, we are reclaiming the food pyramid and fixing a
  system that has been broken for far too long.

  Today, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins introduced the most significant change to federal nutrition 
  guidance in the history of this nation. This is the new pyramid. Dietary guidelines for Americans. A national reset built on real food.
