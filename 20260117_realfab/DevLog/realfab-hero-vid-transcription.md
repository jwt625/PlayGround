# RealFab.org Hero Video Transcription

## Video Script

Here's the transcript for the RealFab announcement video:

---

The semiconductor industry is facing a full-scale manufacturing crisis. More than 90% of advanced chip production is controlled by just three companies. A single leading-edge fab costs over $20 billion to build. Supply chains are fragile, concentrated, and vulnerable.

This did not happen by accident. It happened because distributed fabrication was pushed aside. Replaced by mega-fabs with hundreds of process steps, centralized manufacturing became the foundation of the modern semiconductor industry. And we're paying the price with fragility and waste.

But that ends today. We are resetting how our world makes things. Real fabrication is back at the center of innovation. Additive manufacturing that minimizes waste. Local production that builds resilience. Accessible tools that empower creators. And distributed networks that restore sovereignty.

This is what it takes to build real chips again. Under the vision of open hardware pioneers and the distributed manufacturing movement, we are reclaiming the fabrication paradigm and fixing a system that has been broken for far too long.

Today, we introduce the most significant change to semiconductor manufacturing philosophy in the history of this industry. This is the new pyramid. Fabrication guidelines for makers. A paradigm reset built on real tools.

## Summary

The video is an announcement about a new distributed semiconductor fabrication paradigm, emphasizing a shift from centralized mega-fabs to accessible, additive, local manufacturing, framed as a major industrial and technological initiative.

## Production Notes

### Visual Sequence Suggestions

**0:00 - 0:15** (Crisis Statement)
- Montage of massive fab facilities (TSMC, Intel, Samsung)
- Aerial shots of multi-billion dollar cleanrooms
- Graphics showing concentration: "3 companies = 90%+ control"
- Cost counter ticking up: "$20B+ per fab"

**0:15 - 0:30** (Historical Context)
- Transition to black and white archival footage
- Early semiconductor labs, distributed research
- Shift to modern mega-fab construction time-lapses
- Visual metaphor: Small labs → Giant factories
- Process step counter: "500+ steps"

**0:30 - 0:45** (The Turning Point)
- Color returns, uplifting music begins
- Desktop nanofab tools in action (TPP, LPBF)
- Makers and researchers in accessible labs
- Close-ups of additive manufacturing processes
- Material efficiency visualization: "99% waste → <1% waste"

**1:15 - 1:20** (Closing)
- RealFab.org logo reveal
- Call to action: "Learn More at RealFab.org"
- Upbeat music crescendo and fade

### Audio/Music Direction

- **Tone**: Authoritative yet hopeful, documentary-style narration
- **Voice**: Clear, measured delivery (similar to government PSA style)
- **Music**: 
  - 0:00-0:30: Minimal, slightly tense (building concern)
  - 0:30-0:45: Transition, hope emerging
  - 0:45-1:20: Uplifting, inspirational (orchestral or electronic)
- **Sound Design**: 
  - Subtle industrial sounds (machinery, cleanrooms)
  - Transition to lighter, more organic sounds (desktop tools)
  - Satisfying "pop" sounds as pyramid items appear

### Technical Specifications

   - Cost visualization ($20B+)
   - Process step counter (500+)
   - Material waste comparison (99% → <1%)
   - Network topology (centralized vs. distributed)
   - Pyramid assembly animation

3. **Custom Renders**:
   - Inverted pyramid graphic (matching website design)
   - Tier labels and item icons
   - RealFab.org logo and branding
   - Text overlays and lower thirds

### Alternative Shorter Version (30 seconds)

For social media or quick intro:

---

The semiconductor industry is broken. Three companies control 90%+ of advanced chip production. A single fab costs over $20 billion.

But distributed fabrication is changing everything. Additive manufacturing. Local production. Accessible tools.

This is the new pyramid. Real fabrication for real innovation.
