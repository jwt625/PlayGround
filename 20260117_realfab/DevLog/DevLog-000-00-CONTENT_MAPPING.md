## Conceptual Parallel: Food vs Fabrication

| Real Food (Problem) | Real Fab (Problem) |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| Ultraprocessed food | SOTA nanofab (Big Fab) |
| 1992 Food Pyramid | Moore's Law obsession |
| Added sugars, industrial oils | Hundreds of process steps |
| Centralized food industry | TSMC, Samsung, Intel monopoly |
| Chronic disease epidemic | Supply chain fragility |
| 90% healthcare on chronic disease | 99%+ material waste |

| Real Food (Solution) | Real Fab (Solution) |
|----------------------|----------------------|
| Eat Real Food | Build Real Chips |
| Whole, minimally processed | Additive, direct-write |
| Local, diverse sources | Distributed, decentralized |
| Personal responsibility | DIY empowerment |
| New Pyramid | New Fab Paradigm |

## Section-by-Section Content

### 1. HERO SECTION

**RealFood**: "Eat Real Food"
**RealFab**: "Build Real Chips" or "Fab Locally. Think Globally."

Subheading:
> The semiconductor industry has centralized fabrication into mega-fabs 
> with hundreds of process steps, massive material waste, and monopolistic 
> control. It's time for a revolution in how we make things.

CTAs:
- "View the Manifesto"
- "See the Data"

### 2. STATE OF FABRICATION (Problem Section)

**Heading**: "Our industry is broken. The data is clear."

**Statistics** (scroll-triggered):

| Stat | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 3 | companies control 90%+ of advanced chip manufacturing |
| 500+ | process steps in modern SOTA semiconductor fabrication |
| 99% | of high-purity materials wasted in subtractive processes |
| $20B+ | cost to build a single leading-edge fab |

**Supporting Text**:
> For decades, we've been told that bigger is better - that only 
> trillion-dollar fabs can produce modern electronics. This has led to 
> unprecedented concentration of manufacturing power and fragile 
> global supply chains.

### 3. THE SOLUTION (Text Reveal)

**Disintegrating Text** (like "We can solve this crisis"):
> "We can change this paradigm."

**Follow-up**:
> For the first time, additive manufacturing technologies are enabling 
> distributed, local fabrication. We're rebuilding from the ground up 
> with minimal waste, maximum accessibility, and true resilience.

### 4. THE NEW FAB PYRAMID

**Inverted pyramid visualization**:

**TOP (Foundation - Largest)**:
- **Additive Core Technologies**
  - TPP (Two-Photon Polymerization)
  - LPBF (Laser Powder Bed Fusion)
  - Direct-write lithography
  - 3D printing for electronics

**MIDDLE**:
- **Local & Accessible**
  - Desktop nanofab tools
  - Open-source hardware
  - Community makerspaces
  - University fab labs

**BOTTOM (Peak - Smallest)**:
- **Big Fab (Minimize)**
  - Reserved for extreme cases
  - Not the default

### 5. KEY GUIDANCE (FAQ Section)

1. **What is the New Fab Paradigm?**
   > A framework prioritizing additive over subtractive, local over 
   > centralized, and accessible over gatekept fabrication.

2. **What does "Build Real Chips" mean?**
   > Using minimal-step, low-waste processes that individuals and small 
   > teams can access - not 500-step mega-fab processes.

3. **Why prioritize additive manufacturing?**
   > Additive processes use only what's needed. Subtractive wastes 99%+ 
   > of materials and requires massive infrastructure.

4. **What about performance?**
   > Not every application needs 3nm transistors. The goal is appropriate 
   > technology, not always the smallest node.

5. **How does this improve resilience?**
   > Distributed manufacturing means no single point of failure. Local 
   > fabs can respond to local needs without global dependencies.

6. **What technologies enable this?**
   > TPP for micro/nano structures, LPBF for metal parts, direct-write 
   > for circuits, and evolving desktop tools.

7. **Is this practical today?**
   > Yes, for many applications. The MIT Media Lab's digital fabrication 
   > vision is becoming reality with modern tools.

8. **Who benefits?**
   > Everyone - from researchers to hobbyists to developing nations 
   > seeking technological sovereignty.
