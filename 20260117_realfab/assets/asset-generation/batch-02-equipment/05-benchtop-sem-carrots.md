# Image Generation Prompt: Benchtop SEM (carrots.webp equivalent)

## Subject Description
A desktop scanning electron microscope or high-powered USB microscope - a compact scientific instrument with a cylindrical or boxy body, sample chamber, and viewing interface. Show a benchtop instrument with a distinctive chamber door/opening, control panel, and compact footprint. The instrument should have a precision scientific aesthetic - clean, technical, professional. Include details like the sample chamber, small display or interface, and adjustment controls.

## Style Requirements
**Medium:** Hand-drawn colored pencil illustration with soft wax pastel highlights and opaque gouache for metallic surfaces.

**Texture:** High-grain paper texture throughout. Visible "tooth" of the paper, stippling noise, and dry-brush effects where the pigment breaks over the paper surface. Metal surfaces should show texture through hatching, not photorealistic smoothness.

**Shading & Lighting:** Soft, volumetric shading using hatching and stippling on the instrument body. Gentle gradients on cylindrical surfaces. Highlights are matte and textured (white pigment), never glossy or sharp. IMPORTANT: Cast shadow should be very small, subtle, and stay extremely close to the base - minimal shadow footprint.

**Colors:** White, light gray, and silver for the main body. Dark gray or black for the sample chamber. Subtle blue or green accent for display/interface. Natural but idealized tones with vintage educational chart aesthetic.

**Composition:** Single instrument isolated on SOLID BRIGHT GREEN BACKGROUND (#00FF00 chroma key green). 3/4 view showing the front and one side. Slight isometric perspective. The instrument should be centered and take up similar space in frame as the reference carrots image.

**Background:** CRITICAL - Solid, uniform bright green background (#00FF00 or similar chroma key green) for easy background removal in post-processing. No gradients, no texture, no shadows extending onto the background - just flat green. The cast shadow must be minimal and stay very close to the object.

**Keywords:** Hand-drawn colored pencil illustration, textured paper grain, stippled shading, vintage scientific illustration style, vintage educational chart, dry media, matte finish, green screen background, chroma key green, isolated object, minimal cast shadow, wax pastel, electron microscope, scientific instrument, technical illustration.

## Technical Specs
- **Dimensions:** 2048px width minimum
- **Background:** SOLID BRIGHT GREEN (#00FF00) for chroma key removal
- **Format:** Generate as PNG, will be processed to remove green and convert to WebP with alpha
- **Aspect Ratio:** Portrait or landscape orientation, similar to carrots reference

## Reference Notes
The carrots in the reference are elongated, distinctive, recognizable - our SEM should have similar visual clarity. Focus on the characteristic chamber and compact form. Think vintage scientific equipment catalog.
