# Image Generation Prompt: Soldering Station (strawberry.webp equivalent)

## Subject Description
A quality soldering station - a base unit with temperature control and a soldering iron in its holder. Show a compact benchtop station with a control box (with temperature display and adjustment knob), iron holder/stand, and soldering iron resting in the holder. The station should have a practical workshop tool aesthetic - reliable, accessible, essential. Include details like the temperature display, control knob, iron holder with sponge, and the soldering iron with tip visible.

## Style Requirements
**Medium:** Hand-drawn colored pencil illustration with soft wax pastel highlights and opaque gouache for metallic surfaces.

**Texture:** High-grain paper texture throughout. Visible "tooth" of the paper, stippling noise, and dry-brush effects where the pigment breaks over the paper surface. Metal and plastic surfaces should show texture through hatching, not photorealistic smoothness.

**Shading & Lighting:** Soft, volumetric shading using hatching and stippling on the station body. Gentle gradients on cylindrical iron handle. Highlights are matte and textured (white pigment), never glossy or sharp. IMPORTANT: Cast shadow should be very small, subtle, and stay extremely close to the base - minimal shadow footprint.

**Colors:** Blue or gray for the control box, silver for the iron holder, black or dark gray for the iron handle, metallic silver for the iron tip. Yellow or green sponge in the holder. Natural but idealized tones with vintage educational chart aesthetic.

**Composition:** Single station isolated on SOLID BRIGHT GREEN BACKGROUND (#00FF00 chroma key green). 3/4 view showing the front and one side. Slight isometric perspective. The station should be centered and take up similar space in frame as the reference strawberry image.

**Background:** CRITICAL - Solid, uniform bright green background (#00FF00 or similar chroma key green) for easy background removal in post-processing. No gradients, no texture, no shadows extending onto the background - just flat green. The cast shadow must be minimal and stay very close to the object.

**Keywords:** Hand-drawn colored pencil illustration, textured paper grain, stippled shading, vintage technical illustration style, vintage educational chart, dry media, matte finish, green screen background, chroma key green, isolated object, minimal cast shadow, wax pastel, soldering station, electronics tool, technical illustration.

## Technical Specs
- **Dimensions:** 2048px width minimum
- **Background:** SOLID BRIGHT GREEN (#00FF00) for chroma key removal
- **Format:** Generate as PNG, will be processed to remove green and convert to WebP with alpha
- **Aspect Ratio:** Portrait or square orientation, similar to strawberry reference

## Reference Notes
The strawberry in the reference is compact, recognizable, iconic - our soldering station should have similar visual clarity. Focus on the distinctive iron holder and control box. Think vintage workshop tool catalog.
