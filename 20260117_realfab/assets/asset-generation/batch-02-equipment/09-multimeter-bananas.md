# Image Generation Prompt: Multimeter (bananas.webp equivalent)

## Subject Description
A digital multimeter - a handheld test instrument with a digital display, rotary selector dial, and probe input jacks. Show a classic benchtop or handheld multimeter with a prominent LCD display (showing "888.8" or similar), large rotary function selector in the center, and input jacks at the bottom. The instrument should have a practical tool aesthetic - reliable, straightforward, essential. Include details like the display, selector dial, and input jacks.

## Style Requirements
**Medium:** Hand-drawn colored pencil illustration with soft wax pastel highlights and opaque gouache for the display and controls.

**Texture:** High-grain paper texture throughout. Visible "tooth" of the paper, stippling noise, and dry-brush effects where the pigment breaks over the paper surface. Plastic surfaces should show texture through hatching, not photorealistic smoothness.

**Shading & Lighting:** Soft, volumetric shading using hatching and stippling on the instrument body. Gentle gradients on curved surfaces. Highlights are matte and textured (white pigment), never glossy or sharp. IMPORTANT: Cast shadow should be very small, subtle, and stay extremely close to the base - minimal shadow footprint.

**Colors:** Yellow or orange body (classic Fluke-style), dark gray for the display area, black for the selector dial, silver for input jacks. Natural but idealized tones with vintage educational chart aesthetic.

**Composition:** Single instrument isolated on SOLID BRIGHT GREEN BACKGROUND (#00FF00 chroma key green). 3/4 view showing the front and one side. Slight isometric perspective. The instrument should be centered and take up similar space in frame as the reference bananas image.

**Background:** CRITICAL - Solid, uniform bright green background (#00FF00 or similar chroma key green) for easy background removal in post-processing. No gradients, no texture, no shadows extending onto the background - just flat green. The cast shadow must be minimal and stay very close to the object.

**Keywords:** Hand-drawn colored pencil illustration, textured paper grain, stippled shading, vintage technical illustration style, vintage educational chart, dry media, matte finish, green screen background, chroma key green, isolated object, minimal cast shadow, wax pastel, multimeter, test equipment, technical illustration.

## Technical Specs
- **Dimensions:** 2048px width minimum
- **Background:** SOLID BRIGHT GREEN (#00FF00) for chroma key removal
- **Format:** Generate as PNG, will be processed to remove green and convert to WebP with alpha
- **Aspect Ratio:** Portrait orientation, similar to bananas reference

## Reference Notes
The bananas in the reference are elongated, distinctive, recognizable - our multimeter should have similar visual clarity. Focus on the distinctive dial and display. Think vintage tool catalog.
