# Image Generation Prompt: Oscilloscope (apples.webp equivalent)

## Subject Description
A benchtop oscilloscope - a rectangular test instrument with a display screen, control knobs, and input connectors. Show a modern digital oscilloscope with a prominent LCD screen (showing a simple waveform), multiple channel inputs, and control interface with knobs and buttons. The instrument should have a professional lab equipment aesthetic - clean, technical, reliable. Include details like the screen, input BNC connectors, and control knobs.

## Style Requirements
**Medium:** Hand-drawn colored pencil illustration with soft wax pastel highlights and opaque gouache for the screen and controls.

**Texture:** High-grain paper texture throughout. Visible "tooth" of the paper, stippling noise, and dry-brush effects where the pigment breaks over the paper surface. Metal and plastic surfaces should show texture through hatching, not photorealistic smoothness. The screen should have subtle texture.

**Shading & Lighting:** Soft, volumetric shading using hatching and stippling on the instrument body. Gentle gradients on the screen bezel. Highlights are matte and textured (white pigment), never glossy or sharp. IMPORTANT: Cast shadow should be very small, subtle, and stay extremely close to the base - minimal shadow footprint.

**Colors:** Dark gray or black for the body, blue-gray for the screen, silver for connectors, orange or yellow accents for key controls. Natural but idealized tones with vintage educational chart aesthetic.

**Composition:** Single instrument isolated on SOLID BRIGHT GREEN BACKGROUND (#00FF00 chroma key green). 3/4 view showing the front and one side. Slight isometric perspective. The instrument should be centered and take up similar space in frame as the reference apples image.

**Background:** CRITICAL - Solid, uniform bright green background (#00FF00 or similar chroma key green) for easy background removal in post-processing. No gradients, no texture, no shadows extending onto the background - just flat green. The cast shadow must be minimal and stay very close to the object.

**Keywords:** Hand-drawn colored pencil illustration, textured paper grain, stippled shading, vintage technical illustration style, vintage educational chart, dry media, matte finish, green screen background, chroma key green, isolated object, minimal cast shadow, wax pastel, oscilloscope, test equipment, technical illustration.

## Technical Specs
- **Dimensions:** 2048px width minimum
- **Background:** SOLID BRIGHT GREEN (#00FF00) for chroma key removal
- **Format:** Generate as PNG, will be processed to remove green and convert to WebP with alpha
- **Aspect Ratio:** Landscape orientation, similar to apples reference

## Reference Notes
The apples in the reference are round, recognizable, iconic - our oscilloscope should have similar visual clarity. Focus on the distinctive screen and control interface. Think vintage electronics catalog.
