# Image Generation Prompt: TPP System (salmon.webp equivalent)

## Subject Description
A Two-Photon Polymerization (TPP) system - a benchtop precision instrument with a microscope-like appearance. Show a compact machine with optical components, a stage/platform for samples, and precision controls. The system should have a scientific instrument aesthetic - clean, precise, with visible optics (objective lens, stage). Include subtle details like adjustment knobs and a small control interface. The machine should be desktop-sized, suggesting accessibility.

## Style Requirements
**Medium:** Hand-drawn colored pencil illustration with soft wax pastel highlights and opaque gouache for metallic and optical surfaces.

**Texture:** High-grain paper texture throughout. Visible "tooth" of the paper, stippling noise, and dry-brush effects where the pigment breaks over the paper surface. Metal and optical components should show texture through hatching, not photorealistic smoothness.

**Shading & Lighting:** Soft, volumetric shading using hatching and stippling. The optical components should have gentle gradients. Highlights are matte and textured (white pigment), never glossy or sharp. IMPORTANT: Cast shadow should be very small, subtle, and stay extremely close to the base - minimal shadow footprint.

**Colors:** Silver, gray, and black for the main body. Subtle gold or brass tones for optical components. Dark blue or black for the stage. Natural but idealized tones with vintage educational chart aesthetic.

**Composition:** Single instrument isolated on SOLID BRIGHT GREEN BACKGROUND (#00FF00 chroma key green). 3/4 view showing the front and one side. Slight isometric perspective. The instrument should be centered and take up similar space in frame as the reference salmon image.

**Background:** CRITICAL - Solid, uniform bright green background (#00FF00 or similar chroma key green) for easy background removal in post-processing. No gradients, no texture, no shadows extending onto the background - just flat green. The cast shadow must be minimal and stay very close to the object.

**Keywords:** Hand-drawn colored pencil illustration, textured paper grain, stippled shading, vintage scientific illustration style, vintage educational chart, dry media, matte finish, green screen background, chroma key green, isolated object, minimal cast shadow, wax pastel, precision instrument, microscope, technical illustration.

## Technical Specs
- **Dimensions:** 2048px width minimum
- **Background:** SOLID BRIGHT GREEN (#00FF00) for chroma key removal
- **Format:** Generate as PNG, will be processed to remove green and convert to WebP with alpha
- **Aspect Ratio:** Landscape orientation, similar to salmon reference

## Reference Notes
The salmon in the reference is sleek, elegant, distinctive - our TPP system should have similar visual elegance and clarity. Focus on the distinctive microscope-like silhouette. Simplify internal details. Think vintage scientific equipment catalog.
