# Image Generation Prompt: Pick-and-Place Machine (tomatoes.webp equivalent)

## Subject Description
A desktop pick-and-place machine for SMD assembly - a compact automated machine with a gantry system, pick head with nozzles, and component feeders. Show a desktop-sized machine with visible XY gantry, vacuum nozzle head, and flat work surface with component tape feeders. The machine should have a modern desktop automation aesthetic - precise but accessible. Include details like the gantry rails, pick head, and component feeders along the sides.

## Style Requirements
**Medium:** Hand-drawn colored pencil illustration with soft wax pastel highlights and opaque gouache for metallic surfaces.

**Texture:** High-grain paper texture throughout. Visible "tooth" of the paper, stippling noise, and dry-brush effects where the pigment breaks over the paper surface. Metal and plastic components should show texture through hatching, not photorealistic smoothness.

**Shading & Lighting:** Soft, volumetric shading using hatching and stippling on the machine structure. Gentle gradients on cylindrical gantry rails. Highlights are matte and textured (white pigment), never glossy or sharp. IMPORTANT: Cast shadow should be very small, subtle, and stay extremely close to the base - minimal shadow footprint.

**Colors:** Black or dark gray for the frame, silver for the gantry rails, white or light gray for the work surface. Subtle orange or blue accents for controls. Natural but idealized tones with vintage educational chart aesthetic.

**Composition:** Single machine isolated on SOLID BRIGHT GREEN BACKGROUND (#00FF00 chroma key green). 3/4 view showing the front and one side. Slight isometric perspective. The machine should be centered and take up similar space in frame as the reference tomatoes image.

**Background:** CRITICAL - Solid, uniform bright green background (#00FF00 or similar chroma key green) for easy background removal in post-processing. No gradients, no texture, no shadows extending onto the background - just flat green. The cast shadow must be minimal and stay very close to the object.

**Keywords:** Hand-drawn colored pencil illustration, textured paper grain, stippled shading, vintage technical illustration style, vintage educational chart, dry media, matte finish, green screen background, chroma key green, isolated object, minimal cast shadow, wax pastel, pick and place, SMD assembly, technical illustration.

## Technical Specs
- **Dimensions:** 2048px width minimum
- **Background:** SOLID BRIGHT GREEN (#00FF00) for chroma key removal
- **Format:** Generate as PNG, will be processed to remove green and convert to WebP with alpha
- **Aspect Ratio:** Landscape or portrait orientation, similar to tomatoes reference

## Reference Notes
The tomatoes in the reference are clustered, recognizable, organic - our pick-and-place should have similar visual clarity. Focus on the distinctive gantry system and pick head. Think vintage industrial equipment catalog.
