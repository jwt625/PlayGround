# Image Generation Prompt: Benchtop Power Supply (oranges.webp equivalent)

## Subject Description
A benchtop DC power supply for electronics testing - a laboratory staple that provides adjustable voltage and current. The device should show:
- Rectangular benchtop instrument form factor
- Front panel with digital displays showing voltage/current
- Large control knobs for voltage and current adjustment
- Output terminals (red and black binding posts)
- Professional gray/black housing typical of lab equipment
- Brand-neutral appearance

The power supply represents essential laboratory equipment for electronics development - accessible and fundamental.

## Style Requirements
**Medium:** Hand-drawn colored pencil illustration with soft wax pastel highlights and opaque gouache for the displays.

**Texture:** High-grain paper texture throughout. Visible "tooth" of the paper, stippling noise, and dry-brush effects where the pigment breaks over the paper surface. The instrument housing should show texture through hatching and cross-hatching, not photorealistic smoothness.

**Shading & Lighting:** Soft, volumetric shading using hatching and stippling on the rectangular form. Gentle gradients on panels. The displays should have a subtle glow suggested through lighter values. Highlights are matte and textured (white pigment), never glossy or sharp. IMPORTANT: Cast shadow should be very small, subtle, and stay extremely close to the instrument base - minimal shadow footprint.

**Colors:** Dark gray or black for the housing. Red LED displays or green/blue LCD. Red and black for output terminals. Silver or gray for knobs. Natural but idealized tones with vintage educational chart aesthetic.

**Composition:** Single instrument isolated on SOLID BRIGHT GREEN BACKGROUND (#00FF00 chroma key green). Front 3/4 view showing the control panel and one side. Slight isometric perspective. The instrument should be centered and take up similar space in frame as the reference oranges image.

**Background:** CRITICAL - Solid, uniform bright green background (#00FF00 or similar chroma key green) for easy background removal in post-processing. No gradients, no texture, no shadows extending onto the background - just flat green. The cast shadow must be minimal and stay very close to the object.

**Keywords:** Hand-drawn colored pencil illustration, textured paper grain, stippled shading, vintage technical illustration style, vintage educational chart, dry media, matte finish, green screen background, chroma key green, isolated object, minimal cast shadow, wax pastel, test equipment, power supply, laboratory instrument.

## Technical Specs
- **Dimensions:** 2048px width minimum
- **Background:** SOLID BRIGHT GREEN (#00FF00) for chroma key removal
- **Format:** Generate as PNG, will be processed to remove green and convert to WebP with alpha
- **Aspect Ratio:** Landscape orientation, similar to oranges reference

## Reference Notes
The oranges in the reference are bright, substantial, clustered - our power supply should have similar visual weight and presence. Think vintage electronics test equipment catalog. Green background will be removed in post-processing to create transparent background for animation.
