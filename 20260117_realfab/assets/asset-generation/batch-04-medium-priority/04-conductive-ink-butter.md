# Image Generation Prompt: Conductive Ink (butter.webp equivalent)

## Subject Description
A bottle or syringe of conductive ink for printed electronics - silver or copper nanoparticle ink used for printing circuits. The container should show:
- Small laboratory bottle (30-100ml) or precision syringe dispenser
- Dark metallic liquid visible inside (silver-gray or copper-brown)
- Clean technical label reading "Ag Nanoparticle Ink" or "Conductive Ink"
- Professional laboratory packaging
- Amber glass or clear plastic container
- The ink should have a subtle metallic sheen

The ink represents the "raw material" for printed electronics - enabling circuit fabrication through additive processes.

## Style Requirements
**Medium:** Hand-drawn colored pencil illustration with soft wax pastel highlights and opaque gouache for the metallic liquid.

**Texture:** High-grain paper texture throughout. Visible "tooth" of the paper, stippling noise, and dry-brush effects where the pigment breaks over the paper surface. The container should show texture, not photorealistic smoothness. The ink should have a subtle granular appearance suggesting nanoparticles.

**Shading & Lighting:** Soft, volumetric shading using hatching and stippling on the container. The metallic ink should have gentle gradients and subtle sparkle suggested through stippling. Highlights are matte and textured (white pigment), never glossy or sharp. IMPORTANT: Cast shadow should be very small, subtle, and stay extremely close to the container base - minimal shadow footprint.

**Colors:** Silver-gray or copper-brown for the conductive ink. Clear or amber for the container. Black or white for labels and cap. Natural but idealized tones with vintage educational chart aesthetic. The ink should have a subtle metallic quality without being overly shiny.

**Composition:** Single container isolated on SOLID BRIGHT GREEN BACKGROUND (#00FF00 chroma key green). 3/4 view showing the front label and one side. Slight isometric perspective. The container should be centered and take up similar space in frame as the reference butter image.

**Background:** CRITICAL - Solid, uniform bright green background (#00FF00 or similar chroma key green) for easy background removal in post-processing. No gradients, no texture, no shadows extending onto the background - just flat green. The cast shadow must be minimal and stay very close to the object.

**Keywords:** Hand-drawn colored pencil illustration, textured paper grain, stippled shading, vintage scientific illustration style, vintage educational chart, dry media, matte finish, green screen background, chroma key green, isolated object, minimal cast shadow, wax pastel, laboratory materials, conductive ink, printed electronics, nanomaterials.

## Technical Specs
- **Dimensions:** 2048px width minimum
- **Background:** SOLID BRIGHT GREEN (#00FF00) for chroma key removal
- **Format:** Generate as PNG, will be processed to remove green and convert to WebP with alpha
- **Aspect Ratio:** Portrait orientation, similar to butter reference

## Reference Notes
The butter in the reference is smooth, rich, with a subtle sheen - our conductive ink should have similar visual richness with metallic quality. Think vintage chemistry lab supply catalog. The ink represents the raw material for printed electronics. Green background will be removed in post-processing to create transparent background for animation.
