# Image Generation Prompt: Desktop FDM 3D Printer (butternut.webp equivalent)

## Subject Description
A desktop FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling) 3D printer - the ubiquitous consumer/maker 3D printer for creating enclosures, jigs, and mechanical parts. The printer should show:
- Typical Cartesian or CoreXY frame structure
- Build platform visible
- Extruder/print head assembly
- Frame in black, orange, or silver
- Accessible, consumer-friendly design
- Recognizable as a standard desktop 3D printer (Prusa, Ender style)

The FDM printer represents the most accessible form of additive manufacturing - enabling custom enclosures and mechanical parts for electronics projects.

## Style Requirements
**Medium:** Hand-drawn colored pencil illustration with soft wax pastel highlights and opaque gouache for metallic parts.

**Texture:** High-grain paper texture throughout. Visible "tooth" of the paper, stippling noise, and dry-brush effects where the pigment breaks over the paper surface. The printer frame should show texture through hatching and cross-hatching, not photorealistic smoothness.

**Shading & Lighting:** Soft, volumetric shading using hatching and stippling on the frame structure. Gentle gradients on cylindrical rods and panels. Highlights are matte and textured (white pigment), never glossy or sharp. IMPORTANT: Cast shadow should be very small, subtle, and stay extremely close to the printer base - minimal shadow footprint.

**Colors:** Black, orange, or silver for the frame. Gray for the build platform. Black or silver for the extruder assembly. Natural but idealized tones with vintage educational chart aesthetic.

**Composition:** Single printer isolated on SOLID BRIGHT GREEN BACKGROUND (#00FF00 chroma key green). 3/4 view showing the frame structure and build area. Slight isometric perspective. The printer should be centered and take up similar space in frame as the reference butternut image.

**Background:** CRITICAL - Solid, uniform bright green background (#00FF00 or similar chroma key green) for easy background removal in post-processing. No gradients, no texture, no shadows extending onto the background - just flat green. The cast shadow must be minimal and stay very close to the object.

**Keywords:** Hand-drawn colored pencil illustration, textured paper grain, stippled shading, vintage technical illustration style, vintage educational chart, dry media, matte finish, green screen background, chroma key green, isolated object, minimal cast shadow, wax pastel, 3D printer, FDM, additive manufacturing, maker tools.

## Technical Specs
- **Dimensions:** 2048px width minimum
- **Background:** SOLID BRIGHT GREEN (#00FF00) for chroma key removal
- **Format:** Generate as PNG, will be processed to remove green and convert to WebP with alpha
- **Aspect Ratio:** Square or portrait orientation, similar to butternut reference

## Reference Notes
The butternut squash in the reference is substantial, organic, with distinctive form - our FDM printer should be similarly recognizable with its characteristic frame structure. Think vintage maker tool catalog. Green background will be removed in post-processing to create transparent background for animation.
