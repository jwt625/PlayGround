# Image Generation Prompt: Logic Analyzer (grapes.webp equivalent)

## Subject Description
A USB logic analyzer for digital signal debugging - a compact, affordable tool for analyzing digital circuits. The device should show:
- Small USB dongle or compact box form factor
- Multiple probe connections (8-16 channels)
- Colorful probe wires or connectors
- Modern, accessible design (not traditional benchtop)
- USB cable visible
- Professional but consumer-friendly appearance

The logic analyzer represents modern, affordable test equipment - democratized tools for digital debugging.

## Style Requirements
**Medium:** Hand-drawn colored pencil illustration with soft wax pastel highlights and opaque gouache for the plastic housing.

**Texture:** High-grain paper texture throughout. Visible "tooth" of the paper, stippling noise, and dry-brush effects where the pigment breaks over the paper surface. The device should show texture through hatching and stippling, not photorealistic smoothness.

**Shading & Lighting:** Soft, volumetric shading using hatching and stippling on the device's form. The probe wires should have gentle curves and subtle highlights. Highlights are matte and textured (white pigment), never glossy or sharp. IMPORTANT: Cast shadow should be very small, subtle, and stay extremely close to the device base - minimal shadow footprint.

**Colors:** Black or dark gray for the main device. Colorful wires (red, blue, yellow, green) for the probe connections. Silver for connectors. Natural but idealized tones with vintage educational chart aesthetic.

**Composition:** Single device with probe wires isolated on SOLID BRIGHT GREEN BACKGROUND (#00FF00 chroma key green). 3/4 view showing the device and probe connections. The device should be centered and take up similar space in frame as the reference grapes image - compact but with visual interest from the colorful wires.

**Background:** CRITICAL - Solid, uniform bright green background (#00FF00 or similar chroma key green) for easy background removal in post-processing. No gradients, no texture, no shadows extending onto the background - just flat green. The cast shadow must be minimal and stay very close to the object.

**Keywords:** Hand-drawn colored pencil illustration, textured paper grain, stippled shading, vintage technical illustration style, vintage educational chart, dry media, matte finish, green screen background, chroma key green, isolated object, minimal cast shadow, wax pastel, test equipment, logic analyzer, digital debugging.

## Technical Specs
- **Dimensions:** 2048px width minimum
- **Background:** SOLID BRIGHT GREEN (#00FF00) for chroma key removal
- **Format:** Generate as PNG, will be processed to remove green and convert to WebP with alpha
- **Aspect Ratio:** Square or landscape orientation, similar to grapes reference

## Reference Notes
The grapes in the reference are clustered, colorful, with visual variety - our logic analyzer should have similar visual interest with colorful probe wires. Think modern electronics tool catalog. Green background will be removed in post-processing to create transparent background for animation.
