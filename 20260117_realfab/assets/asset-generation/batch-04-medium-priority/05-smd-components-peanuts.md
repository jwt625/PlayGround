# Image Generation Prompt: SMD Components (peanuts.webp equivalent)

## Subject Description
Surface-mount device (SMD) electronic components in tape and reel packaging - the "building blocks" of electronics assembly. The image should show:
- A section of component tape (clear plastic with pockets)
- Visible SMD components (resistors, capacitors, or ICs) in the pockets
- Black or brown reel partially visible
- Components should be small, precise, uniform
- Professional electronics packaging
- Multiple components visible to show quantity/availability

The components represent the fundamental building blocks of electronics - accessible, standardized, ready to assemble.

## Style Requirements
**Medium:** Hand-drawn colored pencil illustration with soft wax pastel highlights and opaque gouache for the components.

**Texture:** High-grain paper texture throughout. Visible "tooth" of the paper, stippling noise, and dry-brush effects where the pigment breaks over the paper surface. The tape and components should show texture through hatching and stippling, not photorealistic smoothness.

**Shading & Lighting:** Soft, volumetric shading using hatching and stippling. The clear tape should have subtle transparency suggested through lighter values. The components should have gentle highlights. IMPORTANT: Cast shadow should be very small, subtle, and stay extremely close to the tape/reel base - minimal shadow footprint.

**Colors:** Black or brown for the reel. Clear or translucent for the component tape. Dark gray, black, or brown for the SMD components with small metallic accents for terminals. Natural but idealized tones with vintage educational chart aesthetic.

**Composition:** Tape and reel section isolated on SOLID BRIGHT GREEN BACKGROUND (#00FF00 chroma key green). Slight angle showing the tape unwinding from the reel with components visible in pockets. The composition should be centered and take up similar space in frame as the reference peanuts image - showing multiple components clustered together.

**Background:** CRITICAL - Solid, uniform bright green background (#00FF00 or similar chroma key green) for easy background removal in post-processing. No gradients, no texture, no shadows extending onto the background - just flat green. The cast shadow must be minimal and stay very close to the object.

**Keywords:** Hand-drawn colored pencil illustration, textured paper grain, stippled shading, vintage technical illustration style, vintage educational chart, dry media, matte finish, green screen background, chroma key green, isolated object, minimal cast shadow, wax pastel, electronic components, SMD, surface mount, tape and reel.

## Technical Specs
- **Dimensions:** 2048px width minimum
- **Background:** SOLID BRIGHT GREEN (#00FF00) for chroma key removal
- **Format:** Generate as PNG, will be processed to remove green and convert to WebP with alpha
- **Aspect Ratio:** Landscape or square orientation, similar to peanuts reference

## Reference Notes
The peanuts in the reference are clustered, numerous, showing abundance - our SMD components should convey similar abundance and accessibility. Think vintage electronics catalog. The components represent the building blocks of electronics assembly. Green background will be removed in post-processing to create transparent background for animation.
