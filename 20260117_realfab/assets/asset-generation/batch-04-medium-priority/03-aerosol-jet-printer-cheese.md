# Image Generation Prompt: Aerosol Jet Printer (cheese.webp equivalent)

## Subject Description
An Aerosol Jet printing system for printed electronics - a precision deposition tool that prints conductive traces and electronic components. The system should show:
- Compact benchtop or desktop design
- Print head assembly with precision nozzle
- Small build platform or substrate holder
- Industrial white/gray housing
- Control interface or display
- Professional but accessible appearance

The printer represents direct-write printed electronics technology - enabling circuit fabrication without traditional lithography.

## Style Requirements
**Medium:** Hand-drawn colored pencil illustration with soft wax pastel highlights and opaque gouache for metallic surfaces.

**Texture:** High-grain paper texture throughout. Visible "tooth" of the paper, stippling noise, and dry-brush effects where the pigment breaks over the paper surface. The printer should show texture through hatching and cross-hatching, not photorealistic smoothness.

**Shading & Lighting:** Soft, volumetric shading using hatching and stippling on the printer's form. Gentle gradients on panels to show depth. Highlights are matte and textured (white pigment), never glossy or sharp. IMPORTANT: Cast shadow should be very small, subtle, and stay extremely close to the printer base - minimal shadow footprint.

**Colors:** White, light gray, and cool gray tones for the housing. Black or dark gray for the print head and mechanical components. Small accents of industrial blue or orange. Natural but idealized tones with vintage educational chart aesthetic.

**Composition:** Single printer isolated on SOLID BRIGHT GREEN BACKGROUND (#00FF00 chroma key green). 3/4 view showing the front and one side. Slight isometric perspective. The printer should be centered and take up similar space in frame as the reference cheese image.

**Background:** CRITICAL - Solid, uniform bright green background (#00FF00 or similar chroma key green) for easy background removal in post-processing. No gradients, no texture, no shadows extending onto the background - just flat green. The cast shadow must be minimal and stay very close to the object.

**Keywords:** Hand-drawn colored pencil illustration, textured paper grain, stippled shading, vintage technical illustration style, vintage educational chart, dry media, matte finish, green screen background, chroma key green, isolated object, minimal cast shadow, wax pastel, printed electronics, aerosol jet printing, additive manufacturing.

## Technical Specs
- **Dimensions:** 2048px width minimum
- **Background:** SOLID BRIGHT GREEN (#00FF00) for chroma key removal
- **Format:** Generate as PNG, will be processed to remove green and convert to WebP with alpha
- **Aspect Ratio:** Portrait or square orientation, similar to cheese reference

## Reference Notes
The cheese in the reference is solid, substantial, with visible texture - our aerosol jet printer should have similar visual weight with industrial precision. Think vintage technical equipment catalog. The printer represents accessible printed electronics fabrication. Green background will be removed in post-processing to create transparent background for animation.
