# Image Generation Prompt: Hot Air Rework Station (strawberry-right.webp equivalent)

## Subject Description
A hot air rework station for SMD soldering and desoldering - a benchtop tool with a handheld hot air gun. The system should show:
- Base station with temperature display and controls
- Hot air handpiece/gun with nozzle
- Holder or stand for the handpiece
- Professional blue/gray/black housing
- Temperature controls and display visible
- Accessible workshop tool aesthetic

The hot air rework station represents essential SMD assembly and repair equipment - widely available in makerspaces and workshops.

## Style Requirements
**Medium:** Hand-drawn colored pencil illustration with soft wax pastel highlights and opaque gouache for the displays.

**Texture:** High-grain paper texture throughout. Visible "tooth" of the paper, stippling noise, and dry-brush effects where the pigment breaks over the paper surface. The station should show texture through hatching and cross-hatching, not photorealistic smoothness.

**Shading & Lighting:** Soft, volumetric shading using hatching and stippling on the station and handpiece. Gentle gradients on cylindrical forms. The display should have a subtle glow. Highlights are matte and textured (white pigment), never glossy or sharp. IMPORTANT: Cast shadow should be very small, subtle, and stay extremely close to the station base - minimal shadow footprint.

**Colors:** Blue, gray, or black for the base station. Silver or gray for the handpiece. Red or green LED display. Natural but idealized tones with vintage educational chart aesthetic.

**Composition:** Station with handpiece in holder isolated on SOLID BRIGHT GREEN BACKGROUND (#00FF00 chroma key green). 3/4 view showing the front panel and handpiece. Slight isometric perspective. The station should be centered and take up similar space in frame as the reference strawberry-right image.

**Background:** CRITICAL - Solid, uniform bright green background (#00FF00 or similar chroma key green) for easy background removal in post-processing. No gradients, no texture, no shadows extending onto the background - just flat green. The cast shadow must be minimal and stay very close to the object.

**Keywords:** Hand-drawn colored pencil illustration, textured paper grain, stippled shading, vintage technical illustration style, vintage educational chart, dry media, matte finish, green screen background, chroma key green, isolated object, minimal cast shadow, wax pastel, soldering equipment, hot air rework, SMD tools.

## Technical Specs
- **Dimensions:** 2048px width minimum
- **Background:** SOLID BRIGHT GREEN (#00FF00) for chroma key removal
- **Format:** Generate as PNG, will be processed to remove green and convert to WebP with alpha
- **Aspect Ratio:** Portrait or square orientation, similar to strawberry reference

## Reference Notes
The strawberry in the reference is bright, recognizable, with distinctive form - our hot air rework station should be similarly recognizable with the characteristic handpiece. Think vintage workshop tool catalog. Green background will be removed in post-processing to create transparent background for animation.
