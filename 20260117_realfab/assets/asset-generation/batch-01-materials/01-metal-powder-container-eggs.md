# Image Generation Prompt: Metal Powder Container (eggs.webp equivalent)

## Subject Description
A laboratory container of fine metal powder for additive manufacturing - a cylindrical metal canister (similar size to a large egg carton or coffee can) with a secure lid. The container should be made of brushed stainless steel or aluminum with a matte finish. Label visible reading "Ti-6Al-4V" or "316L" in clean technical typography. Through a small viewing window or partially open lid, show fine metallic powder with a silvery-gray appearance, suggesting the texture of very fine sand or flour but with metallic sheen.

## Style Requirements
**Medium:** Hand-drawn colored pencil illustration with soft wax pastel highlights and opaque gouache for metallic surfaces.

**Texture:** High-grain paper texture throughout. Visible "tooth" of the paper, stippling noise, and dry-brush effects where the pigment breaks over the paper surface. The metal container should show texture through hatching and cross-hatching, not photorealistic smoothness. The powder should have a granular, stippled appearance.

**Shading & Lighting:** Soft, volumetric shading using hatching and stippling on the cylindrical container. The brushed metal should have gentle directional grain. Highlights on the metal surface are matte and textured (white pigment), never glossy or sharp. The powder should catch light with subtle sparkle suggested through stippling. IMPORTANT: Cast shadow should be very small, subtle, and stay extremely close to the container base - minimal shadow footprint.

**Colors:** Cool gray and silver tones for the container, silvery-gray with hints of blue for the titanium powder, deep black or dark gray for labels and text. Natural but idealized tones with vintage educational chart aesthetic. The powder should have a subtle metallic quality without being overly shiny.

**Composition:** Single container isolated on SOLID BRIGHT GREEN BACKGROUND (#00FF00 chroma key green). 3/4 view showing the front label and one side. Slight isometric perspective. The container should be centered and take up similar space in frame as the reference eggs image.

**Background:** CRITICAL - Solid, uniform bright green background (#00FF00 or similar chroma key green) for easy background removal in post-processing. No gradients, no texture, no shadows extending onto the background - just flat green. The cast shadow must be minimal and stay very close to the object.

**Keywords:** Hand-drawn colored pencil illustration, textured paper grain, stippled shading, vintage scientific illustration style, vintage educational chart, dry media, matte finish, green screen background, chroma key green, isolated object, minimal cast shadow, wax pastel, laboratory container, metal canister, technical illustration, additive manufacturing materials.

## Technical Specs
- **Dimensions:** 2048px width minimum
- **Background:** SOLID BRIGHT GREEN (#00FF00) for chroma key removal
- **Format:** Generate as PNG, will be processed to remove green and convert to WebP with alpha
- **Aspect Ratio:** Portrait or square orientation, similar to eggs reference

## Reference Notes
The eggs in the reference are simple, organic, clustered together - our metal powder container should have similar visual simplicity and clarity, but with an industrial/technical aesthetic. Think vintage chemistry lab supply catalog. The container represents the "raw ingredient" for metal 3D printing. Green background will be removed in post-processing to create transparent background for animation.
