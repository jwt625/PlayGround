# Image Generation Prompt: Solder Paste Syringe (almond.webp equivalent)

## Subject Description
A solder paste dispensing syringe - a cylindrical syringe barrel (about 4-6 inches long) filled with gray solder paste, with a plunger at the back and a precision dispensing tip at the front. The barrel should be transparent or translucent plastic showing the gray paste inside. The plunger should be simple - typically black or colored plastic. The dispensing tip should be a fine metal or plastic nozzle (like a hypodermic needle but blunt). Optional: small label or markings indicating "Sn63/Pb37" or "SAC305" (solder alloy types). The syringe should look like a precision tool for electronics assembly.

## Style Requirements
**Medium:** Hand-drawn colored pencil illustration with soft wax pastel highlights and opaque gouache for the plastic and metal components.

**Texture:** High-grain paper texture throughout. Visible "tooth" of the paper, stippling noise, and dry-brush effects where the pigment breaks over the paper surface. The plastic barrel should show texture through subtle hatching. The solder paste inside should have a granular, stippled appearance suggesting its paste-like consistency. The metal tip should show texture, not photorealistic smoothness.

**Shading & Lighting:** Soft, volumetric shading using hatching and stippling on the cylindrical syringe. The transparent barrel should have gentle gradients and subtle edge highlights. The solder paste should be visible through the barrel with a matte gray appearance. Highlights on the plastic and metal are matte and textured (white pigment), never glossy or sharp. The plunger should have simple shading. IMPORTANT: Cast shadow should be very small, subtle, and stay extremely close to the syringe - minimal shadow footprint.

**Colors:** Clear or translucent plastic with subtle gray-blue tints for the barrel, medium gray for the solder paste, black or dark blue for the plunger, silver or dark gray for the metal tip. Natural but idealized tones with vintage educational chart aesthetic. The overall impression should be clean and technical.

**Composition:** Single syringe positioned horizontally or at a slight diagonal, isolated on SOLID BRIGHT GREEN BACKGROUND (#00FF00 chroma key green). 3/4 view showing the barrel, paste contents, plunger, and tip clearly. Slight isometric perspective. The syringe should be centered and take up similar space in frame as the reference almond.

**Background:** CRITICAL - Solid, uniform bright green background (#00FF00 or similar chroma key green) for easy background removal in post-processing. No gradients, no texture, no shadows extending onto the background - just flat green. The cast shadow must be minimal and stay very close to the object.

**Keywords:** Hand-drawn colored pencil illustration, textured paper grain, stippled shading, vintage scientific illustration style, vintage educational chart, dry media, matte finish, green screen background, chroma key green, isolated object, minimal cast shadow, wax pastel, precision tool, electronics assembly, technical illustration, solder paste dispenser.

## Technical Specs
- **Dimensions:** 2048px width minimum
- **Background:** SOLID BRIGHT GREEN (#00FF00) for chroma key removal
- **Format:** Generate as PNG, will be processed to remove green and convert to WebP with alpha
- **Aspect Ratio:** Landscape or portrait orientation, similar to almond reference

## Reference Notes
The almond in the reference is simple, small, with distinctive elongated form - our solder paste syringe should have similar visual simplicity and iconic form, but with a technical/precision tool aesthetic. Think vintage electronics assembly manual. The syringe represents accessible assembly materials for circuit board fabrication. Green background will be removed in post-processing to create transparent background for animation.
