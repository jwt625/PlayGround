# Image Generation Prompt: DI Water Bottle (olive-oil.webp equivalent)

## Subject Description
A laboratory bottle of deionized (DI) water - a clear glass or plastic bottle (similar size and shape to an olive oil bottle, about 500ml-1L) with a screw cap or stopper. The bottle should be transparent, showing crystal-clear water inside. Label visible reading "DI H₂O" or "Deionized Water" with purity specifications (like "18.2 MΩ·cm") in clean technical typography. The bottle should have clean, simple lines - either a classic Erlenmeyer flask shape or a simple cylindrical lab bottle. The water should be completely clear and pure-looking.

## Style Requirements
**Medium:** Hand-drawn colored pencil illustration with soft wax pastel highlights and opaque gouache for the glass and water.

**Texture:** High-grain paper texture throughout. Visible "tooth" of the paper, stippling noise, and dry-brush effects where the pigment breaks over the paper surface. The glass should show texture through subtle hatching, not photorealistic smoothness. The water should appear clear but still show paper texture - suggest transparency through careful use of white space and minimal shading.

**Shading & Lighting:** Soft, volumetric shading using hatching and stippling on the bottle. The clear glass should have gentle gradients and subtle edge highlights. The water inside should be suggested through very light blue-gray tints and careful highlight placement. Highlights on the glass and water are matte and textured (white pigment), never glossy or sharp. The cap should be simple - white or blue plastic with minimal detail. IMPORTANT: Cast shadow should be very small, subtle, and stay extremely close to the bottle base - minimal shadow footprint.

**Colors:** Clear glass with very subtle gray-blue tints, pure water with barely-there blue-gray shadows, white or light blue cap, black text on white label. Natural but idealized tones with vintage educational chart aesthetic. The overall impression should be clean, pure, and scientific.

**Composition:** Single bottle isolated on SOLID BRIGHT GREEN BACKGROUND (#00FF00 chroma key green). 3/4 view showing the front label and one side. Slight isometric perspective. The bottle should be centered and take up similar space in frame as the reference olive oil bottle.

**Background:** CRITICAL - Solid, uniform bright green background (#00FF00 or similar chroma key green) for easy background removal in post-processing. No gradients, no texture, no shadows extending onto the background - just flat green. The cast shadow must be minimal and stay very close to the object.

**Keywords:** Hand-drawn colored pencil illustration, textured paper grain, stippled shading, vintage scientific illustration style, vintage educational chart, dry media, matte finish, green screen background, chroma key green, isolated object, minimal cast shadow, wax pastel, laboratory glassware, deionized water, technical illustration, cleanroom materials.

## Technical Specs
- **Dimensions:** 2048px width minimum
- **Background:** SOLID BRIGHT GREEN (#00FF00) for chroma key removal
- **Format:** Generate as PNG, will be processed to remove green and convert to WebP with alpha
- **Aspect Ratio:** Portrait orientation, similar to olive oil bottle reference

## Reference Notes
The olive oil bottle in the reference is simple, elegant, with visible liquid contents - our DI water bottle should have similar visual simplicity and clarity, but with a scientific/laboratory aesthetic. Think vintage chemistry lab supply catalog. The bottle represents essential cleanroom material - pure water for rinsing and processing. Green background will be removed in post-processing to create transparent background for animation.
