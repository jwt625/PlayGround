# Image Generation Prompt: Filament Spools (canned-tuna.webp equivalent)

## Subject Description
Two or three 3D printing filament spools stacked or arranged together. Each spool should be a circular reel (like a thread spool but larger, about 8-10 inches diameter) with filament wound around it. Show different colors: one with standard PLA (white or natural beige), one with conductive filament (dark gray/black with subtle metallic sheen), and optionally one with bright colored filament (blue or red). The spools should have visible center holes and the filament should show the characteristic 1.75mm or 3mm diameter thread wound in neat coils. Simple cardboard or plastic spool construction.

## Style Requirements
**Medium:** Hand-drawn colored pencil illustration with soft wax pastel highlights and opaque gouache for the filament surfaces.

**Texture:** High-grain paper texture throughout. Visible "tooth" of the paper, stippling noise, and dry-brush effects where the pigment breaks over the paper surface. The filament should show texture and the wound coils should be suggested through parallel hatching lines. The spool material (cardboard/plastic) should have a matte, textured appearance.

**Shading & Lighting:** Soft, volumetric shading using hatching and stippling on the cylindrical spools. The wound filament should show gentle gradients following the circular form. Highlights on the filament are matte and textured (white pigment), never glossy or sharp. The conductive filament should have subtle metallic highlights suggested through careful stippling. IMPORTANT: Cast shadow should be very small, subtle, and stay extremely close to the spool base - minimal shadow footprint.

**Colors:** Natural beige/cream for standard filament, dark charcoal gray with subtle silver highlights for conductive filament, vibrant but matte colors for any additional spools (blue, red). Cardboard spools in natural brown/tan. Natural but idealized tones with vintage educational chart aesthetic.

**Composition:** Two or three spools arranged together (one slightly in front, others behind/beside) isolated on SOLID BRIGHT GREEN BACKGROUND (#00FF00 chroma key green). 3/4 view showing the circular form and wound filament clearly. Slight isometric perspective. The arrangement should be centered and take up similar space in frame as the reference canned tuna image.

**Background:** CRITICAL - Solid, uniform bright green background (#00FF00 or similar chroma key green) for easy background removal in post-processing. No gradients, no texture, no shadows extending onto the background - just flat green. The cast shadow must be minimal and stay very close to the objects.

## Technical Specs
- **Dimensions:** 2048px width minimum
- **Background:** SOLID BRIGHT GREEN (#00FF00) for chroma key removal
- **Format:** Generate as PNG, will be processed to remove green and convert to WebP with alpha
- **Aspect Ratio:** Landscape or square orientation, similar to canned tuna reference

## Reference Notes
The canned tuna in the reference is a simple cylindrical can with label - our filament spools should have similar visual simplicity and clarity, but with the distinctive circular spool form and colorful wound filament. Think vintage maker/hobbyist catalog. The spools represent accessible, DIY-friendly materials for distributed fabrication. Green background will be removed in post-processing to create transparent background for animation.
