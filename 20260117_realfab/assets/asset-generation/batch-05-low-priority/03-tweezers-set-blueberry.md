# Image Generation Prompt: Precision Tweezers Set (blueberry.webp equivalent)

## Subject Description
A set of precision tweezers for SMD assembly - essential hand tools for working with tiny electronic components. The image should show:
- 2-3 precision tweezers of different styles (straight, curved, angled)
- Stainless steel construction with fine tips
- Anti-static coating (often black or blue tips)
- Professional electronics assembly tools
- Arranged in a visually appealing composition

The tweezers represent fundamental hand tools for electronics assembly - accessible and essential for precision work.

## Style Requirements
**Medium:** Hand-drawn colored pencil illustration with soft wax pastel highlights and opaque gouache for the metallic surfaces.

**Texture:** High-grain paper texture throughout. Visible "tooth" of the paper, stippling noise, and dry-brush effects where the pigment breaks over the paper surface. The tweezers should show texture through hatching, not photorealistic smoothness.

**Shading & Lighting:** Soft, volumetric shading using hatching and stippling on the tweezers' cylindrical forms. Gentle highlights on the stainless steel. Highlights are matte and textured (white pigment), never glossy or sharp. IMPORTANT: Cast shadow should be very small, subtle, and stay extremely close to the tweezers - minimal shadow footprint.

**Colors:** Stainless steel silver-gray for the bodies. Black or blue for anti-static tips. Natural but idealized tones with vintage educational chart aesthetic.

**Composition:** 2-3 tweezers arranged together isolated on SOLID BRIGHT GREEN BACKGROUND (#00FF00 chroma key green). Slight angle showing the different tip styles. The tweezers should be centered and take up similar space in frame as the reference blueberry image - small but detailed.

**Background:** CRITICAL - Solid, uniform bright green background (#00FF00 or similar chroma key green) for easy background removal in post-processing. No gradients, no texture, no shadows extending onto the background - just flat green. The cast shadow must be minimal and stay very close to the objects.

## Technical Specs
- **Dimensions:** 2048px width minimum
- **Background:** SOLID BRIGHT GREEN (#00FF00) for chroma key removal
- **Format:** Generate as PNG, will be processed to remove green and convert to WebP with alpha
- **Aspect Ratio:** Landscape orientation, similar to blueberry reference

## Reference Notes
The blueberry in the reference is small, simple, singular - our tweezers should have similar scale and simplicity. Think vintage tool catalog. Green background will be removed in post-processing to create transparent background for animation.
