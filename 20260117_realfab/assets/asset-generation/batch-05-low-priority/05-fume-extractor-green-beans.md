# Image Generation Prompt: Fume Extractor (green-beans.webp equivalent)

## Subject Description
A soldering fume extractor for workshop safety - a benchtop device that removes harmful solder fumes. The device should show:
- Compact benchtop design
- Fan housing with intake grille
- Flexible extraction arm or hood
- Filter visible or suggested
- Professional blue/gray/black housing
- Safety equipment aesthetic

The fume extractor represents essential safety equipment for electronics assembly - accessible and important for healthy workshop practices.

## Style Requirements
**Medium:** Hand-drawn colored pencil illustration with soft wax pastel highlights and opaque gouache for the housing.

**Texture:** High-grain paper texture throughout. Visible "tooth" of the paper, stippling noise, and dry-brush effects where the pigment breaks over the paper surface. The device should show texture through hatching and cross-hatching, not photorealistic smoothness.

**Shading & Lighting:** Soft, volumetric shading using hatching and stippling on the device's form. Gentle gradients on cylindrical and curved forms. Highlights are matte and textured (white pigment), never glossy or sharp. IMPORTANT: Cast shadow should be very small, subtle, and stay extremely close to the device base - minimal shadow footprint.

**Colors:** Blue, gray, or black for the housing. Dark gray for the grille. Silver for the flexible arm. Natural but idealized tones with vintage educational chart aesthetic.

**Composition:** Single device with extraction arm isolated on SOLID BRIGHT GREEN BACKGROUND (#00FF00 chroma key green). 3/4 view showing the fan housing and arm. Slight isometric perspective. The device should be centered and take up similar space in frame as the reference green-beans image.

**Background:** CRITICAL - Solid, uniform bright green background (#00FF00 or similar chroma key green) for easy background removal in post-processing. No gradients, no texture, no shadows extending onto the background - just flat green. The cast shadow must be minimal and stay very close to the object.

**Keywords:** Hand-drawn colored pencil illustration, textured paper grain, stippled shading, vintage technical illustration style, vintage educational chart, dry media, matte finish, green screen background, chroma key green, isolated object, minimal cast shadow, wax pastel, fume extractor, safety equipment, soldering tools.

## Technical Specs
- **Dimensions:** 2048px width minimum
- **Background:** SOLID BRIGHT GREEN (#00FF00) for chroma key removal
- **Format:** Generate as PNG, will be processed to remove green and convert to WebP with alpha
- **Aspect Ratio:** Portrait or square orientation, similar to green-beans reference

## Reference Notes
The green beans in the reference are elongated, simple, functional - our fume extractor should have similar functional simplicity. Think vintage safety equipment catalog. Green background will be removed in post-processing to create transparent background for animation.
