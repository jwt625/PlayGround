# Image Generation Prompt: ASML EUV Machine (bread.webp equivalent)

## Subject Description
An ASML Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machine - the most complex and expensive manufacturing tool in the world. This is a massive industrial machine, roughly the size of a bus, with a distinctive boxy, modular appearance. The machine should show:
- Large white/light gray industrial housing with clean panels
- Multiple levels/modules stacked together
- Small windows or viewing ports
- Industrial cable management and connections
- ASML branding visible on the side
- Clean, sterile appearance suggesting cleanroom environment

The machine represents the epitome of centralized, expensive, inaccessible fabrication - the "bread" of Big Fab that should be minimized.

## Style Requirements
**Medium:** Hand-drawn colored pencil illustration with soft wax pastel highlights and opaque gouache for the industrial surfaces.

**Texture:** High-grain paper texture throughout. Visible "tooth" of the paper, stippling noise, and dry-brush effects where the pigment breaks over the paper surface. The machine panels should show texture through hatching and cross-hatching, not photorealistic smoothness. Industrial but still hand-drawn aesthetic.

**Shading & Lighting:** Soft, volumetric shading using hatching and stippling on the machine's boxy form. The white/gray panels should have gentle gradients to show depth and form. Highlights are matte and textured (white pigment), never glossy or sharp. IMPORTANT: Cast shadow should be very small, subtle, and stay extremely close to the machine base - minimal shadow footprint.

**Colors:** Predominantly white, light gray, and cool gray tones for the machine housing. Small accents of industrial blue or yellow for branding/warning labels. Black or dark gray for panel lines, vents, and details. Natural but idealized tones with vintage educational chart aesthetic. The machine should look clean and sterile but not overly shiny.

**Composition:** Single machine isolated on SOLID BRIGHT GREEN BACKGROUND (#00FF00 chroma key green). 3/4 view showing the front and one side to convey the machine's massive, modular structure. Slight isometric perspective. The machine should be centered and take up similar space in frame as the reference bread image - substantial but not overwhelming.

**Background:** CRITICAL - Solid, uniform bright green background (#00FF00 or similar chroma key green) for easy background removal in post-processing. No gradients, no texture, no shadows extending onto the background - just flat green. The cast shadow must be minimal and stay very close to the object.

**Keywords:** Hand-drawn colored pencil illustration, textured paper grain, stippled shading, vintage technical illustration style, vintage educational chart, dry media, matte finish, green screen background, chroma key green, isolated object, minimal cast shadow, wax pastel, industrial equipment, semiconductor manufacturing, technical illustration, ASML EUV lithography.

## Technical Specs
- **Dimensions:** 2048px width minimum
- **Background:** SOLID BRIGHT GREEN (#00FF00) for chroma key removal
- **Format:** Generate as PNG, will be processed to remove green and convert to WebP with alpha
- **Aspect Ratio:** Landscape orientation (machine is wider than tall), similar to bread reference

## Reference Notes
The bread in the reference is simple, everyday, ubiquitous - representing something to minimize. Our ASML EUV machine should convey the opposite message through its complexity and scale: this is the epitome of centralized, expensive, inaccessible fabrication. Think vintage industrial equipment catalog but for the most advanced machine humanity has ever built. The machine represents what we need LESS of in the inverted pyramid. Green background will be removed in post-processing to create transparent background for animation.

## Simplification Note
While the real ASML EUV machine is incredibly complex, simplify it to essential recognizable features - large boxy modules, clean panels, industrial aesthetic. Think "simplified but recognizable" like the food illustrations. Focus on conveying "massive industrial equipment" rather than technical accuracy.
