# Image Generation Prompt: Direct-Write Tool (chicken.webp equivalent)

## Subject Description
A direct-write lithography or inkjet printing system for circuits - a precision desktop machine with a print head/nozzle assembly and a flat build platform. Show a compact machine with visible print head mechanism, XY stage, and control interface. The machine should have a modern maker-tool aesthetic - accessible but precise. Include details like the dispensing nozzle, positioning stage, and simple control panel. Desktop-sized, suggesting DIY accessibility.

## Style Requirements
**Medium:** Hand-drawn colored pencil illustration with soft wax pastel highlights and opaque gouache for metallic surfaces.

**Texture:** High-grain paper texture throughout. Visible "tooth" of the paper, stippling noise, and dry-brush effects where the pigment breaks over the paper surface. Metal and plastic components should show texture through hatching, not photorealistic smoothness.

**Shading & Lighting:** Soft, volumetric shading using hatching and stippling on the machine body. Gentle gradients on curved surfaces. Highlights are matte and textured (white pigment), never glossy or sharp. IMPORTANT: Cast shadow should be very small, subtle, and stay extremely close to the base - minimal shadow footprint.

**Colors:** Light gray, white, and black for the main body. Subtle orange or blue accents for controls. Natural but idealized tones with vintage educational chart aesthetic.

**Composition:** Single machine isolated on SOLID BRIGHT GREEN BACKGROUND (#00FF00 chroma key green). 3/4 view showing the front and one side. Slight isometric perspective. The machine should be centered and take up similar space in frame as the reference chicken image.

**Background:** CRITICAL - Solid, uniform bright green background (#00FF00 or similar chroma key green) for easy background removal in post-processing. No gradients, no texture, no shadows extending onto the background - just flat green. The cast shadow must be minimal and stay very close to the object.

**Keywords:** Hand-drawn colored pencil illustration, textured paper grain, stippled shading, vintage technical illustration style, vintage educational chart, dry media, matte finish, green screen background, chroma key green, isolated object, minimal cast shadow, wax pastel, desktop fabrication, circuit printer, technical illustration.

## Technical Specs
- **Dimensions:** 2048px width minimum
- **Background:** SOLID BRIGHT GREEN (#00FF00) for chroma key removal
- **Format:** Generate as PNG, will be processed to remove green and convert to WebP with alpha
- **Aspect Ratio:** Landscape orientation, similar to chicken reference

## Reference Notes
The chicken in the reference is recognizable, substantial, clean - our direct-write tool should have similar visual clarity. Focus on distinctive print head and stage. Simplify details. Think vintage maker tool catalog.
