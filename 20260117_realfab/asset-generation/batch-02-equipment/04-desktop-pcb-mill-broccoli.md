# Image Generation Prompt: Desktop PCB Mill (broccoli.webp equivalent)

## Subject Description
A benchtop CNC mill for circuit boards (like Bantam Tools or Othermill) - a compact desktop machine with a milling spindle, enclosed work area, and visible cutting bed. Show a small, accessible CNC machine with transparent safety enclosure, spindle assembly, and flat work surface. The machine should have a modern desktop tool aesthetic - professional but approachable. Include details like the spindle, enclosure, and simple control interface.

## Style Requirements
**Medium:** Hand-drawn colored pencil illustration with soft wax pastel highlights and opaque gouache for metallic surfaces.

**Texture:** High-grain paper texture throughout. Visible "tooth" of the paper, stippling noise, and dry-brush effects where the pigment breaks over the paper surface. Metal and acrylic components should show texture through hatching, not photorealistic smoothness. The transparent enclosure should have subtle texture.

**Shading & Lighting:** Soft, volumetric shading using hatching and stippling. The enclosure should have gentle gradients. Highlights are matte and textured (white pigment), never glossy or sharp. IMPORTANT: Cast shadow should be very small, subtle, and stay extremely close to the base - minimal shadow footprint.

**Colors:** Dark gray or black for the base, silver for the spindle, subtle transparency for the enclosure. Green or orange accent for the work bed. Natural but idealized tones with vintage educational chart aesthetic.

**Composition:** Single machine isolated on SOLID BRIGHT GREEN BACKGROUND (#00FF00 chroma key green). 3/4 view showing the front and one side. Slight isometric perspective. The machine should be centered and take up similar space in frame as the reference broccoli image.

**Background:** CRITICAL - Solid, uniform bright green background (#00FF00 or similar chroma key green) for easy background removal in post-processing. No gradients, no texture, no shadows extending onto the background - just flat green. The cast shadow must be minimal and stay very close to the object.

**Keywords:** Hand-drawn colored pencil illustration, textured paper grain, stippled shading, vintage technical illustration style, vintage educational chart, dry media, matte finish, green screen background, chroma key green, isolated object, minimal cast shadow, wax pastel, CNC mill, desktop fabrication, technical illustration.

## Technical Specs
- **Dimensions:** 2048px width minimum
- **Background:** SOLID BRIGHT GREEN (#00FF00) for chroma key removal
- **Format:** Generate as PNG, will be processed to remove green and convert to WebP with alpha
- **Aspect Ratio:** Portrait orientation, similar to broccoli reference

## Reference Notes
The broccoli in the reference is distinctive, organic, recognizable - our PCB mill should have similar visual distinctiveness. Focus on the characteristic enclosed design and spindle. Think vintage tool catalog.
