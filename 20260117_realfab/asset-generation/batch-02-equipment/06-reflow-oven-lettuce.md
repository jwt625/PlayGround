# Image Generation Prompt: Reflow Oven (lettuce.webp equivalent)

## Subject Description
A small reflow oven for PCB assembly - a compact countertop oven with a viewing window, control panel, and heating chamber. Show a toaster-oven-sized machine with a transparent door/window, temperature controls, and simple interface. The oven should have a makerspace tool aesthetic - accessible, practical, straightforward. Include details like the viewing window, control knobs/buttons, and heating chamber visible through the glass.

## Style Requirements
**Medium:** Hand-drawn colored pencil illustration with soft wax pastel highlights and opaque gouache for metallic surfaces.

**Texture:** High-grain paper texture throughout. Visible "tooth" of the paper, stippling noise, and dry-brush effects where the pigment breaks over the paper surface. Metal surfaces should show texture through hatching, not photorealistic smoothness. The viewing window should have subtle texture.

**Shading & Lighting:** Soft, volumetric shading using hatching and stippling on the oven body. Gentle gradients on curved surfaces. Highlights are matte and textured (white pigment), never glossy or sharp. IMPORTANT: Cast shadow should be very small, subtle, and stay extremely close to the base - minimal shadow footprint.

**Colors:** Stainless steel gray or black for the body. Subtle orange glow suggestion in the chamber. Dark glass for the window. Natural but idealized tones with vintage educational chart aesthetic.

**Composition:** Single oven isolated on SOLID BRIGHT GREEN BACKGROUND (#00FF00 chroma key green). 3/4 view showing the front and one side. Slight isometric perspective. The oven should be centered and take up similar space in frame as the reference lettuce image.

**Background:** CRITICAL - Solid, uniform bright green background (#00FF00 or similar chroma key green) for easy background removal in post-processing. No gradients, no texture, no shadows extending onto the background - just flat green. The cast shadow must be minimal and stay very close to the object.

**Keywords:** Hand-drawn colored pencil illustration, textured paper grain, stippled shading, vintage technical illustration style, vintage educational chart, dry media, matte finish, green screen background, chroma key green, isolated object, minimal cast shadow, wax pastel, reflow oven, electronics assembly, technical illustration.

## Technical Specs
- **Dimensions:** 2048px width minimum
- **Background:** SOLID BRIGHT GREEN (#00FF00) for chroma key removal
- **Format:** Generate as PNG, will be processed to remove green and convert to WebP with alpha
- **Aspect Ratio:** Portrait orientation, similar to lettuce reference

## Reference Notes
The lettuce in the reference is leafy, layered, recognizable - our reflow oven should have similar visual clarity. Focus on the distinctive window and compact form. Think vintage appliance catalog.
