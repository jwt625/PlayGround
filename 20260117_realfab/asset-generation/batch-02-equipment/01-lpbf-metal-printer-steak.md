# Image Generation Prompt: LPBF Metal Printer (steak.webp equivalent)

## Subject Description
A Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) metal 3D printer - an industrial-looking machine with a boxy enclosure, viewing window, and visible build chamber. The machine should have a modern industrial aesthetic with clean lines. Show the main body with a transparent or semi-transparent window revealing the build platform inside. Include control panel with buttons/display. The machine should be roughly the size and visual weight of a large microwave or small refrigerator.

## Style Requirements
**Medium:** Hand-drawn colored pencil illustration with soft wax pastel highlights and opaque gouache for metallic surfaces.

**Texture:** High-grain paper texture throughout. Visible "tooth" of the paper, stippling noise, and dry-brush effects where the pigment breaks over the paper surface. Metal surfaces should show texture through hatching, not photorealistic smoothness. The viewing window should have subtle texture, not glossy.

**Shading & Lighting:** Soft, volumetric shading using hatching and stippling on the machine body. Gentle gradients on curved surfaces. Highlights are matte and textured (white pigment), never glossy or sharp. IMPORTANT: Cast shadow should be very small, subtle, and stay extremely close to the machine base - minimal shadow footprint.

**Colors:** Industrial gray, silver, and black for the machine body. Subtle blue or orange accent for control panel lights. Natural but idealized tones with vintage educational chart aesthetic. Avoid overly bright or saturated colors.

**Composition:** Single machine isolated on SOLID BRIGHT GREEN BACKGROUND (#00FF00 chroma key green). 3/4 view showing the front panel and one side. Slight isometric perspective. The machine should be centered and take up similar space in frame as the reference steak image.

**Background:** CRITICAL - Solid, uniform bright green background (#00FF00 or similar chroma key green) for easy background removal in post-processing. No gradients, no texture, no shadows extending onto the background - just flat green. The cast shadow must be minimal and stay very close to the object.

**Keywords:** Hand-drawn colored pencil illustration, textured paper grain, stippled shading, vintage technical illustration style, vintage educational chart, dry media, matte finish, green screen background, chroma key green, isolated object, minimal cast shadow, wax pastel, industrial equipment, 3D printer, technical illustration.

## Technical Specs
- **Dimensions:** 2048px width minimum
- **Background:** SOLID BRIGHT GREEN (#00FF00) for chroma key removal
- **Format:** Generate as PNG, will be processed to remove green and convert to WebP with alpha
- **Aspect Ratio:** Landscape orientation, similar to steak reference

## Reference Notes
The steak in the reference is substantial, recognizable, iconic - our LPBF printer should have similar visual weight and clarity. Simplify details to maintain hand-drawn aesthetic. Focus on distinctive silhouette and key features (window, control panel, build chamber). Think vintage technical manual illustration.
