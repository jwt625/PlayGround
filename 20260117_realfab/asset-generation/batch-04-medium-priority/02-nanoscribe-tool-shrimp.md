# Image Generation Prompt: Nanoscribe Tool (shrimp.webp equivalent)

## Subject Description
A Nanoscribe two-photon polymerization (TPP) system for 3D nanoprinting - a precision benchtop tool for micro/nanoscale fabrication. The system should show:
- Compact benchtop design with microscope-like appearance
- Precision optical components visible
- Small build platform or sample stage
- Clean white/silver housing with black accents
- Professional laboratory aesthetic
- Viewing optics or camera system

The tool represents ultra-high-resolution additive manufacturing at the nanoscale - advanced but increasingly accessible technology.

## Style Requirements
**Medium:** Hand-drawn colored pencil illustration with soft wax pastel highlights and opaque gouache for metallic and optical surfaces.

**Texture:** High-grain paper texture throughout. Visible "tooth" of the paper, stippling noise, and dry-brush effects where the pigment breaks over the paper surface. The tool should show texture through hatching and cross-hatching, not photorealistic smoothness.

**Shading & Lighting:** Soft, volumetric shading using hatching and stippling. Gentle gradients on cylindrical and curved forms. Highlights are matte and textured (white pigment), never glossy or sharp. IMPORTANT: Cast shadow should be very small, subtle, and stay extremely close to the tool base - minimal shadow footprint.

**Colors:** White, silver, and cool gray tones for the housing. Black for optical components and details. Small accents of industrial blue or green for indicator lights. Natural but idealized tones with vintage educational chart aesthetic.

**Composition:** Single tool isolated on SOLID BRIGHT GREEN BACKGROUND (#00FF00 chroma key green). 3/4 view showing the front and one side. Slight isometric perspective. The tool should be centered and take up similar space in frame as the reference shrimp image.

**Background:** CRITICAL - Solid, uniform bright green background (#00FF00 or similar chroma key green) for easy background removal in post-processing. No gradients, no texture, no shadows extending onto the background - just flat green. The cast shadow must be minimal and stay very close to the object.

**Keywords:** Hand-drawn colored pencil illustration, textured paper grain, stippled shading, vintage scientific illustration style, vintage educational chart, dry media, matte finish, green screen background, chroma key green, isolated object, minimal cast shadow, wax pastel, laboratory equipment, nanoscale 3D printing, precision optics.

## Technical Specs
- **Dimensions:** 2048px width minimum
- **Background:** SOLID BRIGHT GREEN (#00FF00) for chroma key removal
- **Format:** Generate as PNG, will be processed to remove green and convert to WebP with alpha
- **Aspect Ratio:** Portrait or square orientation, similar to shrimp reference

## Reference Notes
The shrimp in the reference is curved, detailed, organic - our Nanoscribe tool should have similar visual interest with precision optical components. Think vintage scientific instrument catalog. The tool represents cutting-edge nanoscale fabrication. Green background will be removed in post-processing to create transparent background for animation.
