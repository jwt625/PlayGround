# Image Generation Prompt: SLM Machine (ground-beef.webp equivalent)

## Subject Description
A Selective Laser Melting (SLM) machine for metal 3D printing - similar to LPBF but a distinct variant. This is an industrial metal additive manufacturing system with:
- Enclosed build chamber with viewing window
- Compact industrial design (smaller than LPBF, more accessible)
- Control panel or touchscreen interface
- Clean white/gray industrial housing
- Visible laser optics housing on top
- Professional but approachable appearance

The machine represents accessible metal additive manufacturing technology - a core tool for distributed fabrication.

## Style Requirements
**Medium:** Hand-drawn colored pencil illustration with soft wax pastel highlights and opaque gouache for metallic surfaces.

**Texture:** High-grain paper texture throughout. Visible "tooth" of the paper, stippling noise, and dry-brush effects where the pigment breaks over the paper surface. The machine housing should show texture through hatching and cross-hatching, not photorealistic smoothness.

**Shading & Lighting:** Soft, volumetric shading using hatching and stippling on the machine's form. Gentle gradients on panels to show depth. Highlights are matte and textured (white pigment), never glossy or sharp. IMPORTANT: Cast shadow should be very small, subtle, and stay extremely close to the machine base - minimal shadow footprint.

**Colors:** White, light gray, and cool gray tones for the housing. Small accents of industrial blue or black for control panels. Natural but idealized tones with vintage educational chart aesthetic.

**Composition:** Single machine isolated on SOLID BRIGHT GREEN BACKGROUND (#00FF00 chroma key green). 3/4 view showing the front and one side. Slight isometric perspective. The machine should be centered and take up similar space in frame as the reference ground-beef image.

**Background:** CRITICAL - Solid, uniform bright green background (#00FF00 or similar chroma key green) for easy background removal in post-processing. No gradients, no texture, no shadows extending onto the background - just flat green. The cast shadow must be minimal and stay very close to the object.

**Keywords:** Hand-drawn colored pencil illustration, textured paper grain, stippled shading, vintage technical illustration style, vintage educational chart, dry media, matte finish, green screen background, chroma key green, isolated object, minimal cast shadow, wax pastel, industrial equipment, metal 3D printer, additive manufacturing.

## Technical Specs
- **Dimensions:** 2048px width minimum
- **Background:** SOLID BRIGHT GREEN (#00FF00) for chroma key removal
- **Format:** Generate as PNG, will be processed to remove green and convert to WebP with alpha
- **Aspect Ratio:** Portrait or square orientation, similar to ground-beef reference

## Reference Notes
The ground beef in the reference is chunky, textured, organic - our SLM machine should have similar visual weight but with an industrial aesthetic. Think vintage industrial equipment catalog. The machine represents accessible metal additive manufacturing. Green background will be removed in post-processing to create transparent background for animation.
