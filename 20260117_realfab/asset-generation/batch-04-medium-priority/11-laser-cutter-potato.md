# Image Generation Prompt: Desktop Laser Cutter (potato.webp equivalent)

## Subject Description
A desktop laser cutter/engraver for cutting stencils, panels, and enclosures - a makerspace staple tool. The machine should show:
- Enclosed box design with lid (often acrylic or metal)
- Laser cutting bed visible through window
- Compact desktop form factor
- Industrial design in white, gray, or black
- Ventilation port or exhaust visible
- Professional but accessible appearance

The laser cutter represents accessible subtractive manufacturing - enabling custom panels, stencils, and enclosures for electronics projects.

## Style Requirements
**Medium:** Hand-drawn colored pencil illustration with soft wax pastel highlights and opaque gouache for the housing.

**Texture:** High-grain paper texture throughout. Visible "tooth" of the paper, stippling noise, and dry-brush effects where the pigment breaks over the paper surface. The machine housing should show texture through hatching and cross-hatching, not photorealistic smoothness.

**Shading & Lighting:** Soft, volumetric shading using hatching and stippling on the boxy form. Gentle gradients on panels to show depth. The window should have subtle transparency suggested through lighter values. Highlights are matte and textured (white pigment), never glossy or sharp. IMPORTANT: Cast shadow should be very small, subtle, and stay extremely close to the machine base - minimal shadow footprint.

**Colors:** White, gray, or black for the housing. Clear or translucent for the window/lid. Orange or red for safety labels. Natural but idealized tones with vintage educational chart aesthetic.

**Composition:** Single machine isolated on SOLID BRIGHT GREEN BACKGROUND (#00FF00 chroma key green). 3/4 view showing the front and one side with window visible. Slight isometric perspective. The machine should be centered and take up similar space in frame as the reference potato image.

**Background:** CRITICAL - Solid, uniform bright green background (#00FF00 or similar chroma key green) for easy background removal in post-processing. No gradients, no texture, no shadows extending onto the background - just flat green. The cast shadow must be minimal and stay very close to the object.

**Keywords:** Hand-drawn colored pencil illustration, textured paper grain, stippled shading, vintage technical illustration style, vintage educational chart, dry media, matte finish, green screen background, chroma key green, isolated object, minimal cast shadow, wax pastel, laser cutter, desktop fabrication, maker tools.

## Technical Specs
- **Dimensions:** 2048px width minimum
- **Background:** SOLID BRIGHT GREEN (#00FF00) for chroma key removal
- **Format:** Generate as PNG, will be processed to remove green and convert to WebP with alpha
- **Aspect Ratio:** Landscape or square orientation, similar to potato reference

## Reference Notes
The potato in the reference is substantial, simple, recognizable - our laser cutter should have similar visual simplicity with its characteristic enclosed box form. Think vintage workshop equipment catalog. Green background will be removed in post-processing to create transparent background for animation.
