# Image Generation Prompt: Wafer Fab Interior (oats.webp equivalent)

## Subject Description
Interior view of a traditional semiconductor wafer fabrication facility - showing the massive, complex equipment inside a cleanroom. The scene should show:
- Large industrial processing equipment (CVD, etching, lithography tools)
- Yellow cleanroom lighting (characteristic of photolithography areas)
- Cleanroom environment with smooth floors
- Massive scale of equipment
- Industrial pipes, cables, and infrastructure
- Sterile, high-tech environment

The interior represents the complexity and inaccessibility of traditional semiconductor manufacturing - the epitome of centralized, expensive fabrication.

## Style Requirements
**Medium:** Hand-drawn colored pencil illustration with soft wax pastel highlights and opaque gouache for the equipment.

**Texture:** High-grain paper texture throughout. Visible "tooth" of the paper, stippling noise, and dry-brush effects where the pigment breaks over the paper surface. The equipment should show texture through hatching and cross-hatching, not photorealistic smoothness.

**Shading & Lighting:** Soft, volumetric shading using hatching and stippling on the equipment forms. Yellow-tinted lighting suggested through warm tones. Gentle gradients on large surfaces. Highlights are matte and textured (white pigment), never glossy or sharp. IMPORTANT: Cast shadow should be very small, subtle, and stay extremely close to the equipment bases - minimal shadow footprint.

**Colors:** White and light gray for equipment housing. Yellow tint for cleanroom lighting. Black or dark gray for details and infrastructure. Natural but idealized tones with vintage educational chart aesthetic. The scene should feel sterile and industrial.

**Composition:** Interior scene with equipment isolated on SOLID BRIGHT GREEN BACKGROUND (#00FF00 chroma key green). Perspective view showing depth and scale of equipment. The scene should be centered and take up similar space in frame as the reference oats image - showing the complexity and scale of traditional fab equipment.

**Background:** CRITICAL - Solid, uniform bright green background (#00FF00 or similar chroma key green) for easy background removal in post-processing. No gradients, no texture, no shadows extending onto the background - just flat green. The cast shadow must be minimal and stay very close to the objects.

**Keywords:** Hand-drawn colored pencil illustration, textured paper grain, stippled shading, vintage technical illustration style, vintage educational chart, dry media, matte finish, green screen background, chroma key green, isolated object, minimal cast shadow, wax pastel, semiconductor fab, cleanroom, industrial equipment, wafer processing.

## Technical Specs
- **Dimensions:** 2048px width minimum
- **Background:** SOLID BRIGHT GREEN (#00FF00) for chroma key removal
- **Format:** Generate as PNG, will be processed to remove green and convert to WebP with alpha
- **Aspect Ratio:** Landscape orientation, similar to oats reference

## Reference Notes
The oats in the reference are simple, bland, numerous - our wafer fab interior should convey complexity and inaccessibility through massive equipment. Think vintage industrial photography. The interior represents what we need LESS of - centralized, complex, gatekept manufacturing. Green background will be removed in post-processing to create transparent background for animation.

## Simplification Note
Simplify the fab interior to essential recognizable features - large equipment, yellow lighting, industrial scale. Focus on conveying "massive industrial complexity" rather than technical accuracy.
