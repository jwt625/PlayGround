# Image Generation Prompt: Function Generator (cut-apple.webp equivalent)

## Subject Description
A benchtop function generator (signal generator) for electronics testing - a standard laboratory instrument that generates various waveforms. The device should show:
- Rectangular benchtop instrument form factor
- Front panel with display (LCD or LED)
- Control knobs and buttons
- Output connectors (BNC ports)
- Professional gray/black housing typical of test equipment
- Brand-neutral appearance (generic lab equipment aesthetic)

The function generator represents essential test equipment for electronics development - accessible and widely available.

## Style Requirements
**Medium:** Hand-drawn colored pencil illustration with soft wax pastel highlights and opaque gouache for the display.

**Texture:** High-grain paper texture throughout. Visible "tooth" of the paper, stippling noise, and dry-brush effects where the pigment breaks over the paper surface. The instrument housing should show texture through hatching and cross-hatching, not photorealistic smoothness.

**Shading & Lighting:** Soft, volumetric shading using hatching and stippling on the rectangular form. Gentle gradients on panels. The display should have a subtle glow suggested through lighter values. Highlights are matte and textured (white pigment), never glossy or sharp. IMPORTANT: Cast shadow should be very small, subtle, and stay extremely close to the instrument base - minimal shadow footprint.

**Colors:** Dark gray or black for the housing. Light blue or green for the display. Silver or gray for knobs and connectors. Natural but idealized tones with vintage educational chart aesthetic.

**Composition:** Single instrument isolated on SOLID BRIGHT GREEN BACKGROUND (#00FF00 chroma key green). Front 3/4 view showing the control panel and one side. Slight isometric perspective. The instrument should be centered and take up similar space in frame as the reference cut-apple image.

**Background:** CRITICAL - Solid, uniform bright green background (#00FF00 or similar chroma key green) for easy background removal in post-processing. No gradients, no texture, no shadows extending onto the background - just flat green. The cast shadow must be minimal and stay very close to the object.

**Keywords:** Hand-drawn colored pencil illustration, textured paper grain, stippled shading, vintage technical illustration style, vintage educational chart, dry media, matte finish, green screen background, chroma key green, isolated object, minimal cast shadow, wax pastel, test equipment, function generator, laboratory instrument.

## Technical Specs
- **Dimensions:** 2048px width minimum
- **Background:** SOLID BRIGHT GREEN (#00FF00) for chroma key removal
- **Format:** Generate as PNG, will be processed to remove green and convert to WebP with alpha
- **Aspect Ratio:** Landscape orientation, similar to cut-apple reference

## Reference Notes
The cut apple in the reference shows internal detail and structure - our function generator should show similar detail with visible controls and display. Think vintage electronics test equipment catalog. Green background will be removed in post-processing to create transparent background for animation.
