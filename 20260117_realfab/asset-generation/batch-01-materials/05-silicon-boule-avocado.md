# Image Generation Prompt: Silicon Boule (avocado.webp equivalent)

## Subject Description
A cylindrical silicon crystal boule - the raw form of silicon before it's sliced into wafers. The boule should be a smooth cylinder (about 12 inches long, 8-12 inches diameter) with a characteristic metallic gray appearance and subtle crystalline structure visible on the surface. The silicon should have a distinctive mirror-like sheen with hints of blue, purple, or rainbow iridescence (like an oil slick) due to the thin oxide layer. One end should show the seed crystal attachment point. The surface should appear smooth but with subtle facets or growth patterns suggesting the crystalline nature.

## Style Requirements
**Medium:** Hand-drawn colored pencil illustration with soft wax pastel highlights and opaque gouache for the metallic surface.

**Texture:** High-grain paper texture throughout. Visible "tooth" of the paper, stippling noise, and dry-brush effects where the pigment breaks over the paper surface. The silicon surface should show texture through careful hatching and cross-hatching that follows the cylindrical form. The metallic sheen should be suggested through stippling and careful highlight placement, not photorealistic rendering.

**Shading & Lighting:** Soft, volumetric shading using hatching and stippling on the cylindrical form. The silicon should have gentle gradients following the curve, with subtle iridescent hints (very light blues, purples, golds) suggested through colored pencil layering. Highlights are matte and textured (white or light blue pigment), never sharp or glossy. The crystalline structure can be suggested through subtle linear patterns or facets. IMPORTANT: Cast shadow should be very small, subtle, and stay extremely close to the boule base - minimal shadow footprint.

**Colors:** Metallic gray as the base color, with subtle hints of blue, purple, and gold for iridescence. The overall tone should be cool and silvery. Natural but idealized tones with vintage educational chart aesthetic. The silicon should look precious and pure, like a refined material.

**Composition:** Single boule positioned vertically or at a slight angle, isolated on SOLID BRIGHT GREEN BACKGROUND (#00FF00 chroma key green). 3/4 view showing the cylindrical form and surface characteristics clearly. Slight isometric perspective. The boule should be centered and take up similar space in frame as the reference avocado.

**Background:** CRITICAL - Solid, uniform bright green background (#00FF00 or similar chroma key green) for easy background removal in post-processing. No gradients, no texture, no shadows extending onto the background - just flat green. The cast shadow must be minimal and stay very close to the object.

**Keywords:** Hand-drawn colored pencil illustration, textured paper grain, stippled shading, vintage scientific illustration style, vintage educational chart, dry media, matte finish, green screen background, chroma key green, isolated object, minimal cast shadow, wax pastel, silicon crystal, semiconductor material, technical illustration, crystalline structure, metallic surface.

## Technical Specs
- **Dimensions:** 2048px width minimum
- **Background:** SOLID BRIGHT GREEN (#00FF00) for chroma key removal
- **Format:** Generate as PNG, will be processed to remove green and convert to WebP with alpha
- **Aspect Ratio:** Portrait orientation, similar to avocado reference

## Reference Notes
The avocado in the reference is organic, smooth, with distinctive color and form - our silicon boule should have similar visual simplicity and iconic form, but with a high-tech/industrial aesthetic. Think vintage materials science textbook. The boule represents the origin of all semiconductor manufacturing - the raw crystal before processing. Green background will be removed in post-processing to create transparent background for animation.
