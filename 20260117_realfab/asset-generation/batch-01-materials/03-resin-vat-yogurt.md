# Image Generation Prompt: Resin Vat (yogurt.webp equivalent)

## Subject Description
A rectangular or square resin vat for SLA/DLP 3D printing - a shallow container (similar proportions to a yogurt container but wider and flatter, like a small baking dish). The vat should be made of dark anodized aluminum or black plastic with a transparent or translucent bottom (FEP film). Inside, show amber or clear UV-curable resin partially filling the vat, with a glossy liquid surface. The vat should have simple geometric construction with clean edges and corners. Optional: small handle or grip features on the sides.

## Style Requirements
**Medium:** Hand-drawn colored pencil illustration with soft wax pastel highlights and opaque gouache for the liquid resin.

**Texture:** High-grain paper texture throughout. Visible "tooth" of the paper, stippling noise, and dry-brush effects where the pigment breaks over the paper surface. The metal/plastic vat should show texture through hatching. The liquid resin should have a smooth appearance but still show paper texture - suggest glossiness through careful highlight placement rather than photorealistic rendering.

**Shading & Lighting:** Soft, volumetric shading using hatching and stippling on the vat container. The liquid resin should have gentle gradients and a subtle highlight suggesting its glossy surface. The transparent bottom (FEP film) should be barely visible, perhaps with a slight translucent quality. Highlights on the liquid are matte and textured (white pigment), never sharp or photorealistic. IMPORTANT: Cast shadow should be very small, subtle, and stay extremely close to the vat base - minimal shadow footprint.

**Colors:** Dark charcoal or matte black for the vat body, amber/honey color or clear with slight blue tint for the resin liquid, subtle gray for the transparent FEP film. Natural but idealized tones with vintage educational chart aesthetic. The resin should glow warmly if amber, or have a clean, pure appearance if clear.

**Composition:** Single vat isolated on SOLID BRIGHT GREEN BACKGROUND (#00FF00 chroma key green). 3/4 view from slightly above, showing the rectangular form and the liquid surface clearly. Slight isometric perspective. The vat should be centered and take up similar space in frame as the reference yogurt container.

**Background:** CRITICAL - Solid, uniform bright green background (#00FF00 or similar chroma key green) for easy background removal in post-processing. No gradients, no texture, no shadows extending onto the background - just flat green. The cast shadow must be minimal and stay very close to the object.

## Technical Specs
- **Dimensions:** 2048px width minimum
- **Background:** SOLID BRIGHT GREEN (#00FF00) for chroma key removal
- **Format:** Generate as PNG, will be processed to remove green and convert to WebP with alpha
- **Aspect Ratio:** Portrait or square orientation, similar to yogurt reference

## Reference Notes
The yogurt container in the reference is simple, clean, with visible contents - our resin vat should have similar visual simplicity and clarity, but with an industrial/technical aesthetic. Think vintage lab equipment catalog. The vat represents the liquid "raw material" for high-resolution 3D printing. Green background will be removed in post-processing to create transparent background for animation.
