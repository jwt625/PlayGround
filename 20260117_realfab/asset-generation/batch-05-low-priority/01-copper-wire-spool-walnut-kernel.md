# Image Generation Prompt: Copper Wire Spool (walnut-kernel.webp equivalent)

## Subject Description
A spool of fine copper wire for wire bonding or coil winding - precision wire used in electronics assembly. The spool should show:
- Small plastic or cardboard spool
- Fine copper wire wound on the spool (visible metallic orange-copper color)
- Professional electronics packaging
- Label showing wire gauge (e.g., "30 AWG" or "0.25mm")
- The wire should have a subtle metallic sheen

The copper wire represents precision interconnect materials - accessible and fundamental for electronics assembly.

## Style Requirements
**Medium:** Hand-drawn colored pencil illustration with soft wax pastel highlights and opaque gouache for the metallic wire.

**Texture:** High-grain paper texture throughout. Visible "tooth" of the paper, stippling noise, and dry-brush effects where the pigment breaks over the paper surface. The spool should show texture, and the wire should have fine parallel lines suggesting winding.

**Shading & Lighting:** Soft, volumetric shading using hatching and stippling on the spool. The copper wire should have gentle highlights suggesting metallic quality. Highlights are matte and textured (white pigment), never glossy or sharp. IMPORTANT: Cast shadow should be very small, subtle, and stay extremely close to the spool base - minimal shadow footprint.

**Colors:** Orange-copper for the wire. White, gray, or tan for the spool. Black for labels. Natural but idealized tones with vintage educational chart aesthetic. The wire should have a subtle metallic quality.

**Composition:** Single spool isolated on SOLID BRIGHT GREEN BACKGROUND (#00FF00 chroma key green). 3/4 view showing the wire winding and label. Slight isometric perspective. The spool should be centered and take up similar space in frame as the reference walnut-kernel image.

**Background:** CRITICAL - Solid, uniform bright green background (#00FF00 or similar chroma key green) for easy background removal in post-processing. No gradients, no texture, no shadows extending onto the background - just flat green. The cast shadow must be minimal and stay very close to the object.

**Keywords:** Hand-drawn colored pencil illustration, textured paper grain, stippled shading, vintage technical illustration style, vintage educational chart, dry media, matte finish, green screen background, chroma key green, isolated object, minimal cast shadow, wax pastel, copper wire, electronics materials, wire bonding.

## Technical Specs
- **Dimensions:** 2048px width minimum
- **Background:** SOLID BRIGHT GREEN (#00FF00) for chroma key removal
- **Format:** Generate as PNG, will be processed to remove green and convert to WebP with alpha
- **Aspect Ratio:** Square orientation, similar to walnut-kernel reference

## Reference Notes
The walnut kernel in the reference is small, detailed, with natural texture - our copper wire spool should have similar scale and detail. Think vintage electronics supply catalog. Green background will be removed in post-processing to create transparent background for animation.
