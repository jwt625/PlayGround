# Image Generation Prompt: Hand Tools Set (blueberries.webp equivalent)

## Subject Description
A set of basic hand tools for electronics work - wire cutters, pliers, and screwdrivers. The image should show:
- 3-5 essential hand tools arranged together
- Wire cutters/flush cutters
- Needle-nose pliers
- Small screwdrivers (Phillips and flathead)
- Professional quality with comfortable grips
- Typical red/black/blue handles

The hand tools represent fundamental workshop equipment - universally accessible and essential for electronics assembly.

## Style Requirements
**Medium:** Hand-drawn colored pencil illustration with soft wax pastel highlights and opaque gouache for the handles.

**Texture:** High-grain paper texture throughout. Visible "tooth" of the paper, stippling noise, and dry-brush effects where the pigment breaks over the paper surface. The tools should show texture through hatching and stippling, not photorealistic smoothness.

**Shading & Lighting:** Soft, volumetric shading using hatching and stippling on the tools' forms. Gentle highlights on metal parts and handles. Highlights are matte and textured (white pigment), never glossy or sharp. IMPORTANT: Cast shadow should be very small, subtle, and stay extremely close to the tools - minimal shadow footprint.

**Colors:** Red, black, or blue for handles. Silver-gray for metal parts. Natural but idealized tones with vintage educational chart aesthetic.

**Composition:** 3-5 tools arranged together isolated on SOLID BRIGHT GREEN BACKGROUND (#00FF00 chroma key green). Slight angle showing the variety of tools. The tools should be centered and take up similar space in frame as the reference blueberries image - clustered together showing abundance.

**Background:** CRITICAL - Solid, uniform bright green background (#00FF00 or similar chroma key green) for easy background removal in post-processing. No gradients, no texture, no shadows extending onto the background - just flat green. The cast shadow must be minimal and stay very close to the objects.

**Keywords:** Hand-drawn colored pencil illustration, textured paper grain, stippled shading, vintage technical illustration style, vintage educational chart, dry media, matte finish, green screen background, chroma key green, isolated object, minimal cast shadow, wax pastel, hand tools, electronics tools, workshop equipment.

## Technical Specs
- **Dimensions:** 2048px width minimum
- **Background:** SOLID BRIGHT GREEN (#00FF00) for chroma key removal
- **Format:** Generate as PNG, will be processed to remove green and convert to WebP with alpha
- **Aspect Ratio:** Landscape orientation, similar to blueberries reference

## Reference Notes
The blueberries in the reference are clustered, numerous, showing abundance - our hand tools should convey similar accessibility and variety. Think vintage tool catalog. Green background will be removed in post-processing to create transparent background for animation.
