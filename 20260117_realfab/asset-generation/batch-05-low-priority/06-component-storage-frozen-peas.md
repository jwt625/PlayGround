# Image Generation Prompt: Component Storage (frozen-peas.webp equivalent)

## Subject Description
An organized component storage system for electronics parts - drawer organizer or compartment box for resistors, capacitors, and ICs. The system should show:
- Multi-drawer cabinet or compartment box
- Clear or labeled drawers/compartments
- Visible organization system
- Professional workshop storage
- Compact benchtop or wall-mounted design
- Practical, accessible aesthetic

The component storage represents workshop organization - essential for efficient electronics assembly and prototyping.

## Style Requirements
**Medium:** Hand-drawn colored pencil illustration with soft wax pastel highlights and opaque gouache for the drawers.

**Texture:** High-grain paper texture throughout. Visible "tooth" of the paper, stippling noise, and dry-brush effects where the pigment breaks over the paper surface. The storage unit should show texture through hatching and cross-hatching, not photorealistic smoothness.

**Shading & Lighting:** Soft, volumetric shading using hatching and stippling on the cabinet's form. Gentle gradients on drawer fronts to show depth. Highlights are matte and textured (white pigment), never glossy or sharp. IMPORTANT: Cast shadow should be very small, subtle, and stay extremely close to the unit base - minimal shadow footprint.

**Colors:** Gray, beige, or blue for the cabinet. Clear or translucent for drawer fronts. Black or white for labels. Natural but idealized tones with vintage educational chart aesthetic.

**Composition:** Single storage unit isolated on SOLID BRIGHT GREEN BACKGROUND (#00FF00 chroma key green). Front 3/4 view showing the drawer organization. Slight isometric perspective. The unit should be centered and take up similar space in frame as the reference frozen-peas image.

**Background:** CRITICAL - Solid, uniform bright green background (#00FF00 or similar chroma key green) for easy background removal in post-processing. No gradients, no texture, no shadows extending onto the background - just flat green. The cast shadow must be minimal and stay very close to the object.

**Keywords:** Hand-drawn colored pencil illustration, textured paper grain, stippled shading, vintage technical illustration style, vintage educational chart, dry media, matte finish, green screen background, chroma key green, isolated object, minimal cast shadow, wax pastel, component storage, workshop organization, electronics tools.

## Technical Specs
- **Dimensions:** 2048px width minimum
- **Background:** SOLID BRIGHT GREEN (#00FF00) for chroma key removal
- **Format:** Generate as PNG, will be processed to remove green and convert to WebP with alpha
- **Aspect Ratio:** Portrait or square orientation, similar to frozen-peas reference

## Reference Notes
The frozen peas in the reference are organized, contained, numerous - our component storage should convey similar organization and abundance. Think vintage workshop equipment catalog. Green background will be removed in post-processing to create transparent background for animation.
