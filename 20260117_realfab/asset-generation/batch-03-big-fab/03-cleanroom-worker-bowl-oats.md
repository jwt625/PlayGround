# Image Generation Prompt: Cleanroom Worker (bowl-oats.webp equivalent)

## Subject Description
A person in full cleanroom attire (bunny suit) working in a semiconductor fabrication facility. The figure should show:
- Full-body cleanroom suit in white or light blue
- Hood covering entire head and hair
- Face mask and safety goggles/face shield
- Gloves (white or blue nitrile)
- Cleanroom boots or shoe covers
- Standing or working posture, perhaps holding a wafer carrier or examining something
- The figure should convey "gatekept expertise" and "inaccessible process"

The worker represents the barrier to entry in traditional semiconductor manufacturing - you need specialized training, expensive facilities, and strict protocols. This is the "bowl of oats" - bland, gatekept, inaccessible.

## Style Requirements
**Medium:** Hand-drawn colored pencil illustration with soft wax pastel highlights and opaque gouache for the cleanroom suit.

**Texture:** High-grain paper texture throughout. Visible "tooth" of the paper, stippling noise, and dry-brush effects where the pigment breaks over the paper surface. The cleanroom suit should show texture through hatching and cross-hatching, not photorealistic smoothness. The fabric should have a soft, matte appearance with gentle folds and wrinkles.

**Shading & Lighting:** Soft, volumetric shading using hatching and stippling on the figure's form. The white/light blue suit should have gentle gradients to show depth and body form underneath. Highlights are matte and textured (white pigment), never glossy or sharp. IMPORTANT: Cast shadow should be very small, subtle, and stay extremely close to the figure's feet - minimal shadow footprint.

**Colors:** Predominantly white or light blue for the cleanroom suit. Transparent or light gray for face shield/goggles. Subtle skin tones visible through face shield (optional). Black or dark gray for details like seams, zippers, or equipment. Natural but idealized tones with vintage educational chart aesthetic. The suit should look clean and sterile but not overly shiny.

**Composition:** Single figure isolated on SOLID BRIGHT GREEN BACKGROUND (#00FF00 chroma key green). 3/4 view or front view showing the full cleanroom attire. Standing posture, perhaps holding a silicon wafer carrier or inspection tool. The figure should be centered and take up similar space in frame as the reference bowl-oats image - human scale, recognizable.

**Background:** CRITICAL - Solid, uniform bright green background (#00FF00 or similar chroma key green) for easy background removal in post-processing. No gradients, no texture, no shadows extending onto the background - just flat green. The cast shadow must be minimal and stay very close to the object.

**Keywords:** Hand-drawn colored pencil illustration, textured paper grain, stippled shading, vintage technical illustration style, vintage educational chart, dry media, matte finish, green screen background, chroma key green, isolated object, minimal cast shadow, wax pastel, cleanroom worker, bunny suit, semiconductor manufacturing, technical illustration, laboratory worker.

## Technical Specs
- **Dimensions:** 2048px width minimum
- **Background:** SOLID BRIGHT GREEN (#00FF00) for chroma key removal
- **Format:** Generate as PNG, will be processed to remove green and convert to WebP with alpha
- **Aspect Ratio:** Portrait orientation (figure is taller than wide), similar to bowl reference

## Reference Notes
The bowl of oats in the reference is simple, bland, everyday - representing something to minimize. Our cleanroom worker should convey gatekeeping and inaccessibility: this is what you need to become to work in traditional semiconductor manufacturing - fully suited, trained, working in expensive facilities. Think vintage safety manual or industrial training illustration. The worker represents what we need LESS of in the inverted pyramid - barriers to entry and gatekept processes. Green background will be removed in post-processing to create transparent background for animation.

## Simplification Note
Simplify the cleanroom suit to essential recognizable features - full body coverage, hood, mask, gloves. Think "simplified but recognizable" like the food illustrations. Focus on conveying "specialized protective equipment" and "gatekept expertise" rather than technical accuracy. The figure should be friendly/neutral in posture, not intimidating - we're critiquing the system, not the workers.
