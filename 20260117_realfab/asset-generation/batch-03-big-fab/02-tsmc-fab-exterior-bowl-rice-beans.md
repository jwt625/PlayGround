# Image Generation Prompt: TSMC Fab Exterior (bowl-rice-beans.webp equivalent)

## Subject Description
A modern semiconductor fabrication facility exterior - a massive, windowless industrial building representing centralized chip manufacturing. The building should show:
- Large rectangular/cubic structure with clean, modern lines
- Predominantly white, light gray, or beige exterior panels
- Minimal or no windows (cleanroom facilities are sealed)
- Industrial ventilation systems visible on roof
- TSMC or generic "FAB 18" signage on the building
- Parking lot or industrial surroundings suggested minimally
- Scale indicators like small trees or vehicles to show massive size

The building represents centralized, monopolistic, inaccessible fabrication infrastructure - the "bowl of rice and beans" that fills you up but lacks diversity.

## Style Requirements
**Medium:** Hand-drawn colored pencil illustration with soft wax pastel highlights and opaque gouache for the building surfaces.

**Texture:** High-grain paper texture throughout. Visible "tooth" of the paper, stippling noise, and dry-brush effects where the pigment breaks over the paper surface. The building panels should show texture through hatching and cross-hatching, not photorealistic smoothness. Architectural but still hand-drawn aesthetic.

**Shading & Lighting:** Soft, volumetric shading using hatching and stippling on the building's geometric form. The large flat surfaces should have gentle gradients to show depth and dimension. Highlights are matte and textured (white pigment), never glossy or sharp. IMPORTANT: Cast shadow should be very small, subtle, and stay extremely close to the building base - minimal shadow footprint.

**Colors:** Predominantly white, light gray, beige, and cool gray tones for the building exterior. Small accents of industrial blue or corporate colors for signage. Black or dark gray for panel lines, vents, and architectural details. Natural but idealized tones with vintage educational chart aesthetic. The building should look clean and modern but not overly shiny.

**Composition:** Single building isolated on SOLID BRIGHT GREEN BACKGROUND (#00FF00 chroma key green). 3/4 view showing the front and one side to convey the building's massive, imposing scale. Slight isometric perspective. The building should be centered and take up similar space in frame as the reference bowl-rice-beans image - substantial and filling the frame.

**Background:** CRITICAL - Solid, uniform bright green background (#00FF00 or similar chroma key green) for easy background removal in post-processing. No gradients, no texture, no shadows extending onto the background - just flat green. The cast shadow must be minimal and stay very close to the object.

**Keywords:** Hand-drawn colored pencil illustration, textured paper grain, stippled shading, vintage architectural illustration style, vintage educational chart, dry media, matte finish, green screen background, chroma key green, isolated object, minimal cast shadow, wax pastel, industrial building, semiconductor fab, technical illustration, modern architecture.

## Technical Specs
- **Dimensions:** 2048px width minimum
- **Background:** SOLID BRIGHT GREEN (#00FF00) for chroma key removal
- **Format:** Generate as PNG, will be processed to remove green and convert to WebP with alpha
- **Aspect Ratio:** Landscape orientation (building is wider than tall), similar to bowl reference

## Reference Notes
The bowl of rice and beans in the reference is filling, ubiquitous, but monotonous - representing something to minimize in favor of variety. Our TSMC fab exterior should convey centralization and scale: this is where ALL the chips come from, massive and monolithic. Think vintage industrial architecture illustration. The building represents what we need LESS of in the inverted pyramid - centralized manufacturing monopolies. Green background will be removed in post-processing to create transparent background for animation.

## Simplification Note
Simplify the building to essential recognizable features - large rectangular form, clean panels, minimal windows, industrial rooftop equipment. Think "simplified but recognizable" like the food illustrations. Focus on conveying "massive industrial facility" and "centralized manufacturing" rather than architectural accuracy. Consider adding a small scale reference (tiny car or tree) to emphasize the building's enormous size.
