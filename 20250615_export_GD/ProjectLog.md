# Google Drive Export Project Log

## Project Overview
**Goal**: Export files from organization-managed Google Drive account without service account access

## Session History

### Session 1 - June 15, 2025

#### Environment Setup
- **Issue**: Python venv creation and activation problems
- **Problem**: Python executable not found in activated venv, PATH conflicts with pyenv
- **Resolution**: Updated ~/.zshrc PATH to prioritize Homebrew Python over Framework Python
- **Status**: Python 3.11.9 working in virtual environment

#### Initial Approach: Service Account
- **Attempted**: Creating service account JSON for Google Drive API
- **Blocker**: Cannot create Google Cloud project due to organization restrictions
- **File Created**: `test.py` (service account approach - abandoned)

#### Second Approach: OAuth 2.0
- **Attempted**: OAuth flow for personal authentication
- **Blocker**: Still requires Google Cloud project creation for OAuth credentials
- **Files Created**: 
  - `OAuth_test.py` (OAuth approach - requires project)
  - `instructions.md` (OAuth setup guide)

#### Third Approach: Web Automation
- **Decision**: Use browser automation to simulate manual downloads
- **Options Evaluated**:
  1. **Selenium** - Most common, easily detectable
  2. **Playwright** - Modern, less detectable, better performance
  3. **Mouse clickers** - Fragile, most detectable
  4. **Google Takeout** - Manual but reliable alternative

- **Final Choice**: Playwright for learning opportunity and better stealth

#### Files Created
1. `test.py` - Service account approach (abandoned)
2. `OAuth_test.py` - OAuth approach (requires GCP project)
3. `instructions.md` - OAuth setup instructions
4. `selenium_drive.py` - Selenium automation script
5. `playwright_drive.py` - **Selected solution** - Playwright automation

## Technical Decisions

### Why Playwright Over Selenium?
- **Stealth**: Better at avoiding bot detection
- **Performance**: Faster execution, built-in waiting
- **Modern**: More reliable selectors and async support
- **Learning**: New technology for user to explore

### Key Features Implemented
- **Authentication**: Manual login step to avoid bot detection
- **Randomization**: Random delays between actions
- **Stealth Mode**: Removed automation markers from browser
- **Download Handling**: Automatic download monitoring
- **Folder Navigation**: Support for specific folders or full drive
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for different UI elements

## Major Script Updates

### Update 1: Recursive Download with Rate Limiting
**Date**: June 15, 2025 (continued)
**Changes**: Complete rewrite of download logic

#### New Features Added:
1. **Manual Folder Navigation**: User navigates to target folder before script starts
2. **Recursive Directory Traversal**: Automatically processes subfolders
3. **Individual File Downloads**: Downloads files one-by-one instead of bulk selection
4. **Progressive Rate Limiting**: Smart delays that increase with download count
5. **Folder Structure Preservation**: Maintains hierarchy without ZIP files

#### Rate Limiting Strategy:
- **Base delay**: 2 seconds between downloads
- **Progressive backoff**: +0.5s every 10 downloads  
- **Random jitter**: Adds unpredictability to timing
- **Download counter**: Tracks progress and adjusts behavior

#### Technical Implementation:
- `get_current_folder_items()`: Identifies files vs folders in current directory
- `download_individual_file()`: Downloads single files with rate limiting
- `download_folder_recursively()`: Traverses directory tree depth-first
- `apply_rate_limit()`: Implements progressive delay strategy

#### User Experience Improvements:
- **Interactive start**: User confirms when ready to begin
- **Progress tracking**: Shows files/folders being processed
- **Clear navigation**: Logs folder entry/exit for visibility
- **Error handling**: Graceful fallbacks for UI element detection

## Current Status
- âœ… Playwright script created with stealth features
- âœ… Download monitoring implemented
- âœ… **NEW**: Recursive folder traversal implemented
- âœ… **NEW**: Individual file download with rate limiting
- âœ… **NEW**: Manual folder navigation workflow
- ðŸ”„ Ready for testing and refinement

## Next Steps
1. Install Playwright: `pip install playwright`
2. Install browser: `playwright install chromium`
3. Test script with Google Drive folder
4. Refine UI selectors based on actual Drive interface
5. Add file type filtering and exclusion options
6. Implement resume capability for interrupted downloads

## Technical Notes
- **User Agent**: Using realistic Chrome user agent
- **Viewport**: Standard desktop resolution (1920x1080)
- **Automation Markers**: Removed webdriver detection properties
- **Download Directory**: Configurable, defaults to `./playwright_downloads`
- **Rate Limiting**: Progressive delays from 2s to 5s+ based on download count
- **File Detection**: Uses `data-tooltip` attributes to identify Drive items
- **Folder Detection**: Looks for folder icons to distinguish from files

## Lessons Learned
- Organization-managed Google accounts have API restrictions
- Browser automation is viable alternative when API access is blocked
- Playwright offers better stealth capabilities than Selenium
- Manual authentication step reduces bot detection risk
- **NEW**: Individual file downloads are less suspicious than bulk operations
- **NEW**: Progressive rate limiting helps avoid Google's bot detection
- **NEW**: UI selectors may need adjustment based on Drive interface variations
