# Playground

Feels like I have played with various programming stuff over the years. Maybe it is worth documenting and sharing.

Projects that have spun off:
- [VoiceModeTranscript](https://github.com/jwt625/VoiceModeTranscript): a real-time transcript recorder for ChatGPT voice conversations with dual audio capture, whisper.cpp streaming, and intelligent LLM deduplication.
  - actually works for any mic and system audio transcribing
- [BPM (Beam Propagation Method)](https://github.com/jwt625/BPM): a toy Python library for simulating beam propagation in integrated photonics using the Beam Propagation Method (BPM). Try it: [huggingface.co/spaces/jwt625/BPM](https://huggingface.co/spaces/jwt625/BPM).

- [psh (Programmable Snippet Helper)](https://github.com/jwt625/psh): a text expansion tool with directive-based syntax for dynamic snippet expansion. Reuse frequently-used prompts for LLMs without repetitive typing. Type `;;d.ne,l2` instead of "be concise, no emoji" every time.
