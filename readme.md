# Playground

Feels like I have played with various programming stuff over the years. Maybe it is worth documenting and sharing.

Projects that have spun off:
- [VoiceModeTranscript](https://github.com/jwt625/VoiceModeTranscript): a real-time transcript recorder for ChatGPT voice conversations with dual audio capture, whisper.cpp streaming, and intelligent LLM deduplication.
  - actually works for any mic and system audio transcribing
- [BPM (Beam Propagation Method)](https://github.com/jwt625/BPM): a toy Python library for simulating beam propagation in integrated photonics using the Beam Propagation Method (BPM).
- [Tab Tree Tracker](https://github.com/jwt625/TabTreeTracker): a Chrome extension that visualizes your browser tab navigation history as an interactive tree structure. Track, analyze, and visualize how your browsing sessions evolve over time.
