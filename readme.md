# Playground

Feels like I have played with various programming stuff over the years. Maybe it is worth documenting and sharing.

Projects that have spun off:
- [VoiceModeTranscript](https://github.com/jwt625/VoiceModeTranscript): a real-time transcript recorder for ChatGPT voice conversations with dual audio capture, whisper.cpp streaming, and intelligent LLM deduplication.
  - actually works for any mic and system audio transcribing
- [BPM (Beam Propagation Method)](https://github.com/jwt625/BPM): a toy Python library for simulating beam propagation in integrated photonics using the Beam Propagation Method (BPM).
- [Tab Tree Tracker](https://github.com/jwt625/TabTreeTracker): a Chrome extension that visualizes your browser tab navigation history as an interactive tree structure. Track, analyze, and visualize how your browsing sessions evolve over time.
- [Bay Bridge Traffic Cam](https://github.com/jwt625/bay-bridge-traffic-cam): a comprehensive real-time traffic detection and monitoring system for Bay Bridge with **Prometheus + Grafana integration** and **public dashboard access**.
- [3dgs-viewer](https://github.com/jwt625/3dgs-viewer): simple 3d gaussian splatting viewer based on [spark](https://github.com/sparkjsdev/spark).
- [GDSJam](https://github.com/jwt625/gdsjam/): Web-based live collaborative GDSII viewer for semiconductor layout visualization. Website: [gdsjam.com](https://gdsjam.com/).
- [psh (Programmable Snippet Helper)](https://github.com/jwt625/psh): a text expansion tool with directive-based syntax for dynamic snippet expansion. Reuse frequently-used prompts for LLMs without repetitive typing. Type `;;d.ne,l2` instead of "be concise, no emoji" every time.
