  "summary": "The blog post mentions circuitQED in a section about prompt autocompletion, and discusses an additively manufactured UHV chamber that can maintain ultra-high vacuum conditions. While no direct superconducting qubit papers are cited, the UHV chamber technology is relevant to SC qubit experiments which require ultra-high vacuum environments. The circuitQED mention indicates the author's familiarity with the field."
